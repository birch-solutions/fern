title: "What is Fern?"
---

**Fern is an open source format for defining REST APIs.** You can think of it
like a programming language to describe your API: your endpoints, types,
errors, and examples.

The magic of Fern is our **compiler.** We "compile" your API definition into
useful outputs, like:

-   **Idiomatic SDKs.** Client libraries speed up internal developement, and help
    acquire customers who use your API.
-   **Server-side code generation.** We automatically generate all the boilerplate on the server
    side, like Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot.
-   A **Postman collection**, complete with examples of successful and unsuccessful requests.
-   An **OpenAPI spec**, which you can feed into the endless list of tools that support OpenAPI.
