Fern makes it easy to code generate SDKs, server interfaces, a Postman collection, and an OpenAPI spec.

### Generate SDKs

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

`fern-typescript`: A JavaScript SDK, fully typed with TypeScript declarations. Build Node.js, web, and mobile web applications.

#### Java

`fern-java`: A Java SDK.

#### Python

`fern-python`: A Python SDK. _(coming soon!)_

### Generate server interfaces

#### TypeScript Express

`fern-typescript`: Validation that your JavaScript or TypeScript Express server correctly implements your API.

#### Java Spring

`fern-java`: Validation that your Java Spring server correctly implements your API.

#### Python FastAPI

`fern-python`: Validation that your Python FastAPI server correctly implements your API. _(coming soon!)_

### Generate a Postman Collection

`postman`: generates a [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/collection). If you'd like to use the Postman integration to auto-update your collection, [read on](../features/postman.md).

### Generate an OpenAPI spec

`openapi`: generates an [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) (also known as an OpenAPI spec).

## Contributing

Fern gives a lot of importance to being a community project, and we rely on your help as much as you rely on ours. If you'd like to write a code generator, [reach out](mailto:hey@buildwithfern.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20writing%20a%20code%20generator).
