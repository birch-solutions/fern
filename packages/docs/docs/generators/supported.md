Fern makes it easy to code generate SDKs, server interfaces, a Postman collection, and an OpenAPI document.

### Generate SDKs

- **fern-typescript**: a JavaScript SDK, fully typed with TypeScript declarations. Build Node.js, web, and mobile web applications.
- **fern-java**: A Java SDK.
- **fern-python**: A Python SDK. _(coming soon!)_

### Generate server interfaces

- **fern-typescript**: validation that your JavaScript or TypeScript Express server correctly implements your API.
- **fern-java**: validation that your Java Spring server correctly implements your API.
- **python-fastapi-server**: validation that your Python FastAPI server correctly implements your API. _(coming soon!)_

### Generate a Postman Collection

**postman**: generates a [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/collection). If you'd like to use the Postman integration to auto-update your collection, [read on](../features/postman.md).

### Generate an OpenAPI document

**openapi**: generates an [OpenAPI document](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/).
