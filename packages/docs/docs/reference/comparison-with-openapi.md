# How is Fern different than OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)?

- Higher-quality code generation: Fern is more restrictive in what you can model, enabling idiomatic, easy-to-use code generation.

- Protocol agnostic: Fern lets you define RESTful services alongside WebSocket subscriptions.

- Ease of use: Fern runs code generators remotely and manages publishing packages to registries (e.g., NPM, Maven, PyPI). You get a dependency that you can start using right away.
