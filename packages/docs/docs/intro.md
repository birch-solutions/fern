## What is Fern?

Fern is a suite of tools for building and managing REST APIs. The cornerstone is a Fern API Definition which describes HTTP services in YAML and servers as a single source of truth. Fern uses this API Definition to to generate clients, servers, and documentation.

## Why use Fern?

### 🌐 **Offer your customers SDKs**

Let developers use the programming language of their choice to communicate with your API.

### 💻 **Auto generate code**

Code generators produce language native SDKs (client libraries) and server stubs that follow language-specific style (e.g. Pythonic).

### 🔁 **Sync your docs to your API**

Auto update your documentation website, Postman collection, and OpenAPI spec whenever your API definition changes.
