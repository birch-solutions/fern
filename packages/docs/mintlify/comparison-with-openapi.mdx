title: "Comparison with OpenAPI"
---

We built Fern from the ground up to address our own dissatisfaction with OpenAPI. We differ from OpenAPI in three key areas:

- **Ease of use**
- **Quality of code generation**
- **Focus on server-side API development**
- **Change management**
- **Cloud-based code generation and publishing**

## Ease of use

The Fern specification was built to be **easy to write and easy to read.** Take,
for example, OpenAPI's classic [Pet Store API](https://petstore.swagger.io/).

Here's how you would define the `getPetById` endpoint in Fern:

<Accordion title="Fern Example.">

```yaml
services:
  http:
    PetStoreService:
      docs: Everything about your pets
      base-path: /pet
      auth: false
      endpoints:
        getPetById:
          docs: Find a pet by its ID
          path: /{petId}
          path-parameters:
            petId:
              docs: ID of the pet to return
              type: integer
          method: GET
          response: Pet
          errors:
            - InvalidPetIdError
            - PetNotFoundError
types:
  Pet:
    properties:
      id: integer
      name: string
errors:
  InvalidPetIdError:
    status-code: 400
  PetNotFoundError:
    status-code: 404
```

</Accordion>

And here's the equivalent OpenAPI (taken from their website):

<Accordion title="OpenAPI Example">

```json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "pet",
      "description": "Everything about your pets"
    }
  ],
  "paths": {
    "/pet/{petId}": {
      "get": {
        "tags": ["pet"],
        "summary": "Find a pet by its ID",
        "operationId": "getPetById",
        "produces": ["application/json"],
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "petId",
            "in": "path",
            "description": "ID of the pet to return",
            "required": true,
            "type": "integer",
            "format": "int64"
          }
        ],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "successful operation",
            "schema": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Pet"
            }
          },
          "400": {
            "description": "Invalid ID supplied"
          },
          "404": {
            "description": "Pet not found"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "definitions": {
    "Pet": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["id", "name"],
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

## Quality of code generation

We built Fern from first principles to ensure that **we will always generate
idimoatic code.** There's a number of footguns in OpenAPI: if you use them,
it's impossible to generate high-quality code. Here's some examples:

- Inline types\*\* in an OpenAPI spec makes it impossible to generate idiomatic
  code, as most langauges do not support anonymous type declarations.
- It's easy to define non-discriminated unions in OpenAPI, which makes for
  tricky-to-use SDKs. In many languages, this makes it difficult or impossible
  to deserialize JSON correctly.
- Common errors (like `PetNotFoundError` in the above example) cannot be reused
  in OpenAPI.
  This results is duplicative generated code that doesn't feel handwritten.
- OpenAPI's `anyOf` concept is impossible to represent in most programming
  languages in sub-exponential time.

Pitfalls like these are why it's common for OpenAPI generated code to
[not compile](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%22doesn%27t+compile%22).

Beyond the format, we've built Fern based on best practices in compiling. This includes:

- **Semantic validation** (e.g. disallowing references to types that haven't been defined)
- **Building the compiler to be modular,** as we have multiple independent outputs
  (e.g. TypeScript SDK, Postman Collection).
- **Producing an intermediate representation** so that different generators don't
  have implement duplicative logic. Beyond saving time, this reduces errors and
  increases consistency among outputs.
- **Using AST representations,** rather than templating, to enable more complex and
  idiomatic code generation

## Focus on server-side API development

OpenAPI is focused primarily on documentation and SDK generation, and is not very
helpful for backend API development. The best you'll get from OpenAPI are _server stubs_,
which aren't too helpful once you already have a backend.

In comparison, we've focused heavily on server-side integration, as that's where
most of the API development process occurs! In particular, we:

- **Auto-generate the types** (e.g. Pydantic models for FastAPI)
- **Auto-generate the networking logic** (e.g. FastAPI routes)
- **Auto-generate exceptions** that you can throw. Fern handles converting to the
  correct HTTP status code.
- **Auto-generate server interfaces** for you to implement your business logic.
  This ensure you implement your API correctly. For example, if you return the
  wrong type for an endpoint, you'll get a compile error.

## Change management

An important difference between Fern and OpenAPI is our strategy around versioning
and change management.

With OpenAPI, you're beholden to their infamous [features matrices](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java#schema-support-feature); if you want to use a feature, you first need to ensure that all your generators support it.

In comparison, we've built a custom migration framework for our intermediate
representation so that most new features are implicitly supported by older
generators. And when a migration isn't possible, you'll get a clear error from
our compiler of how you can remediate.

## Cloud-based code generation and publishing

Fern can run your code generation in the cloud. This improves reliability as we
run the generators in consistent, containerized environments. You run `fern generate`
and _it just works_. You don't need to have Java on your computer installed to
generate a Java SDK.

Fern handles publishing too. We don't just spit out a bunch of code and say
"good luck." Fern can publish directly to registries (e.g. npm, Maven) and to
[GitHub repos](https://github.com/ravenappdev/raven-node).
