Fern supports a wide-variety of OpenAPI extensions so that you can customize your SDK beyond the defaults.

## SDK Method Names

By default, Fern uses the `tag` and `operationId` fields to generate the SDK method. So an endpoint with a
tag `users` and operationId `users_create` will generate an SDK that reads `client.users.create()`.

If you would rather explicitly set the values you can leverage the extensions `x-fern-sdk-group-name` and
`x-fern-sdk-method-name`.

The following OpenAPI will generate a sdk that reads `client.users.create()`.

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the top of the client.
For example, the following OpenAPI will generate an sdk that reads `client.create_user()`.

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create_user
```

## Enum Descriptions

OpenAPI doesn't natively support adding descriptions to enum values. To do this in Fern you can use the `x-fern-enum`
extension.

In the example below, we've added some descriptions to a couple of enum values. These descriptions will
propagate into the generated SDK and docs website.

```openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - clubs
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - spades
      x-fern-enum: # <------
        clubs:
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

There are occasions when the enum strings are not code-friendly
(i.e. do not start with a letter & only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens).
If this is the case, [fern check](/compiler/cli-reference#`fern check`) will flag this. To fix, you can specify
code friendly names in the `x-fern-enum` extension. See below:

```openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - "(lub5" # <----- This enum value is not code-friendly
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - Spades
      x-fern-enum:
        "(lub5":
          name: Clubs # <------ Code-friendly name
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

## Customizing Schema Names

OpenAPI allows you to define inlined schemas that do not have names.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object # <---------- Inline Type
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

When Fern generates an SDK for this OpenAPI, we will automatically generate names for all the inlined types.
Tye corresponding TypeScript code fro the OpenAPI above is something like:

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: CastItem[]
}

export interface CastItem  { # <----- Auto-generated name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

If you want to override the generated name, you can use the extension `x-fern-type-name`. For example,

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            x-fern-type-name: Person # <----------
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

would replace `CastItem` with `Person` and the generated code would read more idiomatically:

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: Person[]
}

export interface Person  { # <----- Overridden name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```
