To use an OpenAPI spec with Fern, add it to your API's `definition/` folder.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    └─ openapi.json # <--- also supports openapi.yml
```

Run `fern check` to validate the OpenAPI spec.

If there are no errors, you can run [fern generate](../compiler/generate).

## Convert OpenAPI to a Fern Definition

If you'd rather maintain a Fern Definition instead of OpenAPI, then you can run a one-time conversion.

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <path to openapi>
```
