description: "If you already have an OpenAPI, you can still use Fern's generators."

Fern is interoperable with OpenAPI. All you have to do is add it to your API Definition folder.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json 
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ openapi.json # <---
```

If you run `fern check` then fern will validate the OpenAPI.
