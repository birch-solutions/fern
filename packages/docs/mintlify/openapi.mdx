title: "Bring your OpenAPI description"
description: "If you already have an OpenAPI, you can still use Fern's generators."

To start using your OpenAPI description, all you have to do is add it to your API Definition folder. See below.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml #
  └─ definition/
    └─ openapi.json # <---
```

If you run `fern check` then fern will lint the OpenAPI. As long as `fern check` does not surface any errors, you can use all of Fern's generators.

## Conversion to a Fern definition

If you'd rather start writing a Fern Definition, then you can import your OpenAPI by doing:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <path to openapi>
```

Think of this as a one-time import from OpenAPI into Fern.
