## `fern generate [--group <group>]`

`fern generate` runs the compiler. It will validate your API and run the
generators specified in `generators.yml`.

If you don't have a `default-group` specified in `generators.yml`, then you must
specify a group using the `--group` option.

## `fern upgrade`

`fern upgrade` will upgrade your compiler version in `fern.config.json` to the
latest version. It will also upgrade your generators to the _minimum_ versions that
are compatible with the latest version of the compiler.

## `fern check`

`fern check` will validate that your API is valid.

## `fern init`

`fern init` adds a new API to your repo.

## `fern register`

_Advanced feature._ You can register your API so it can be depended on by other
APIs. Read more in the [Depending on other APIs](/advanced/depending-on-other-apis) section.
