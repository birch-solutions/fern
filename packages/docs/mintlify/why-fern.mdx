title: "Why Fern?"
---

Google built gRPC. Amazon built Smithy. Facebook built GraphQL. Palantir built Conjure.

These inventions all share a common purpose: **automate the API development process.**

We built Fern to

-   Developers spend too much time writing boilerplate code.
-   Product development is slower and more error-prone without type-safe client libraries.
-   Mainting multiple sources of truth for your API is a recipe for runtime errors in production.
