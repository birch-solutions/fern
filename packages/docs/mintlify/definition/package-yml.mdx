## What is a package?

Every folder in your API Definition is a package.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/ # <------ root package
    ├─ api.yml
    ├─ imdb.yml
    └─ persons/ # <-------- nested package
      ├─ director.yml
```

The generated SDK will match the hierarchy of your API definition.

```ts
const client = new Client();

// calling endpoint defined in imdb.yml
client.imdb.getRating("goodwill-hunting");

// calling endpoint defined in persons/director.yml
client.persons.director.get("christopher-nolan");
```

## Package Configuration

Each package can have a special file called `__package__.yml`. The structure of
`__package__.yml` is just like any other definition file in Fern. It can have [imports](imports),
[types](types), [endpoints](endpoints), and [errors](errors).

When you define endpoints in `__package__.yml` they will appear at the root
in the generated SDK. For example, for the following SDK the `submitRating`
function appears at the root.

```ts
const client = new Client();

client.submitRating("goodwill-hunting", 9.5);
```

To generate this SDK, the Fern folder may look something like

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ __package__.yml # <--- 
    └─ api.yml
```

and `__package__.yml` would read

```yaml
service:
  base-path: ""
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    submitRating:
      method: POST
      path: "/submit-rating/{movieId}"
      path-parameters:
        movieId: string
      request:
        type: double
        docs: Rating of the movie
```

## Namespacing

Each package has its own namespace. This allows you to reuse names of
types and errors across different packages.

This is useful when versioning APIs, because you want to increment your
API version you can just copy the existing API to a new package and start
making changes.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb/
        └─ v1/
          └─ movie.yml # type names can overlap with v2/movie.yml
        └─ v2/
          └─ movie.yml
```
