              docs: >-
                The name of a compatible [Cohere

                or command-r-plus) or the ID of a

            documents:
              type: optional<list<string>>
              docs: >
                A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate
                a more accurate reply. Each document is either a string or
                document object with content and metadata.

            max_tokens:
              type: optional<integer>
              docs: >
                The maximum number of tokens the model will generate as part of
                the response. Note: Setting a low value may result in incomplete
                generations.
            stop_sequences:
              type: optional<list<string>>
              docs: >
                A list of up to 5 strings that the model will use to stop
                generation. If the model generates a string that matches any of
                the strings in the list, it will stop generating tokens and
                return the generated text up to that point not including the
                stop sequence.
            temperature:
              type: optional<float>
              docs: >
                Defaults to `0.3`.


                A non-negative float that tunes the degree of randomness in
                generation. Lower temperatures mean less random generations, and
                higher temperatures mean more random generations.


                Randomness can be further maximized by increasing the  value of
                the `p` parameter.
