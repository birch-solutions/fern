            marks the player as connected.


            # Player Tokens and Reserved Slots


            Player tokens reserve a spot in the lobby until they expire. This
            allows for

            precise matchmaking up to exactly the lobby's player limit, which is

            important for games with small lobbies and a high influx of players.


            By calling this endpoint with the player token, the player's spot is
            marked

            as connected and will not expire. If this endpoint is never called,
            the

            player's token will expire and this spot will be filled by another
            player.


            # Anti-Botting


            Player tokens are only issued by caling
            \`rivet.api.matchmaker#JoinLobby\`, calling
            \`rivet.api.matchmaker#FindLobby\`, or

            from the \`rivet.api.identity.common#GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin\`
            event.

            These endpoints have anti-botting measures (i.e. enforcing max
            player

            limits, captchas, and detecting bots), so valid player tokens
            provide some

            confidence that the player is not a bot.


            Therefore, it's important to make sure the token is valid by waiting
            for

            this endpoint to return OK before allowing the connected socket to
            do

            anything else. If this endpoint returns an error, the socket should
            be

            disconnected immediately.


            # How to Transmit the Player Token


            The client is responsible for acquiring the player token by caling

            \`rivet.api.matchmaker#JoinLobby\`, calling
            \`rivet.api.matchmaker#FindLobby\`,

            or from the
            \`rivet.api.identity.common#GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin\`

            event.  Beyond that, it's up to the developer how the player token
            is

            transmitted to the lobby.


            If using WebSockets, the player token can be transmitted as a query

            paramter.


            Otherwise, the player token will likely be automatically sent by the
            client

            once the socket opens. As mentioned above, nothing else should
            happen until

            the player token is validated.
