In this quickstart, we'll install Fern, initialize a sample API, and generate a TypeScript Node.js SDK. The output files will be downloaded to your local file system.

We'll use an [**OpenAPI specification**](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi) (OAS) file to describe our endpoints, types, and errors. 

## Prerequisites 

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) 18 or higher
## Instructions
### Step 1: Install Fern
Use the `npm` CLI command to install Fern globally.

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Step 2: Initialize Fern 

```bash
fern init
```

This will create a `fern/` folder which contains a sample OAS file for the Swagger Petstore API. Generally, you can place this repository in your backend git repository. Optionally, you can keep it in a separate repository dedicated to your API, as seen with [Seam API](https://github.com/seamapi/fern-config)).

<CodeBlock title="fern/">
```yml
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ openapi/
  ├─ openapi.yaml  # the Swagger Petstore OpenAPI sepc
```
</CodeBlock>

The `openapi.yaml` file is used by Fern to generate **code for SDKs** as well as **API Reference documentation**. This Quickstart is concerned with generating code for SDKs. To learn how to generate a documentation site, refer to the [Fern Docs Quickstart](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/overview/fern-docs-quickstart).

### Step 3: Generate code

By default, `generators.yml` contains the TypeScript Node.js generator.

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```diff
default-group: local
groups:
  local:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typscript-node-sdk
        version: 0.x.x
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../generated/sdks/typescript
```
</CodeBlock>

To invoke the generator, run:

```bash
fern generate
```

By default, Fern runs the generator in the cloud to create SDK files from your API definition, then downloads the files to your computer. Once the process is complete, you'll see new files in `../generated/sdks/typescript/`.

Note: The `generated/` folder will be created one level up from the `fern/` folder.

## What's next

Congratulations! You installed Fern, initialized a sample API, and generated your first SDK. 

As a next step, you can:
- Replace the sample OAS file with your own and generate a new SDK
- Configure additional code [generators](/overview/welcome/generators)
- Publish the Node.js SDK to [npm & GitHub](/generate-sd-ks/generators/type-script-node-js-sdk#publish-a-public-package) *paid feature*
- Explore generating documentation with the [Fern Docs Quickstart](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/overview/fern-docs-quickstart)
