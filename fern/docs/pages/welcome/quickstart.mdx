### Install

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Already have an OpenAPI spec?

Import your OpenAPI spec into Fern [here](/api-definition/open-api-specification/openapi/import).

### The `fern/` directory

The `fern/` directory contains your Fern configuration. This generally lives in your
backend repo, but you can also have an independent repo dedicated to your API (like [Seam's](https://github.com/seamapi/fern-config)).

In the root of your repo, run:

```bash
fern init
```

This will create the following folder structure in your project:

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
  └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```

### Generating an SDK

To generate the TypeScript SDK and an OpenAPI spec, run:

```bash
fern generate
```

By default, `generators.yml` is configured to generate a TypeScript SDK and an
OpenAPI spec. You can read more about generation on the [`fern generate`](/overview/cli/fern-generate)
page.

### Defining your API

```yaml imdb.yml
types:
  MovieId: string

  Movie:
    properties:
      id: MovieId
      title: string
      rating:
        type: double
        docs: The rating scale is one to five stars

service:
  auth: false
  base-path: /movies
  endpoints:
    getMovie:
      method: GET
      path: /{movieId}
      path-parameters:
        movieId: MovieId
      response: Movie
      errors:
        - MovieDoesNotExistError

errors:
  MovieDoesNotExistError:
    status-code: 404
    type: MovieId
```

Your **Fern Definition** is a set of YAML files that describe your API. You can
learn more about this in the [Define your API](/api-definition/fern-definition/overview) section.
