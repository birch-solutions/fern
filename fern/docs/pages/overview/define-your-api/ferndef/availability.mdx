You can add `availability` to an endpoint, type, or property within your Fern Definition.

Availability can be:
- `in-development` which means it is being worked on; will show a `Beta` tag
- `pre-release` which means it is available; will show a `Beta` tag
- `deprecated` which means it will be removed in the future; will show a `Deprecated` tag
- `generally-available` which means it is stable and available for use; will show a `GA` tag
