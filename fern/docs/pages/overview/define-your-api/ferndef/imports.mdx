title: Imports in Fern Definition 
description: Use imports to reference API types and errors from other Fern Definition files.
---

Imports allow you to reference types and errors from other files.

<CodeBlock title="persion.yml">
```yaml
types:
  Person: ...
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="family.yml">
```yaml
imports:
  person: ./path/to/person.yml
types:
  Family:
    properties:
      people: list<person.Person> # use an imported type
```
</CodeBlock>

Note that you can only import files that exist in your Fern Definition (i.e., in the same `definition/` folder).
