title: Use fern init to start a Fern project
description: The command "fern init" initializes a new Fern workspace with a sample API definition and Fern configuration files.
---

`fern init` initializes a new Fern workspace in the current folder. 

## Usage

<CodeBlock title='Fern CLI command'>
```bash
fern init
```
</CodeBlock>

This command creates a `fern/` folder with the following folder structure:

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ definition/ # Fern Definition files
    ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
    └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```

The `fern.config.json` file contains root-level configuration for your project. Make sure to update the organization name in this file with your own. The version in this file is the Fern version number and should match the output from `fern version`. 

The `generators.yml` file contains settings for the generators you want to use. By default, it uses the TypeScript SDK generator. Use [fern add](/overview/cli/commands) to add generators, and edit the file to remove generators.

The `definition/` folder contains default Fern Definition files defining a sample API. To use OpenAPI in your project instead of Fern Definition, delete this folder and replace it with a folder named `openapi/` that contains your OpenAPI specification file (such as `openapi.yaml`).
