`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. A pre-requisite is a folder within your Fern directory named `openapi` that contains a `json` or `yml` file.

When ran successfully, this command produces no output in the command line, and creates a new folder within your `fern` directory called `definition`.

## Usage

```bash
fern write-definition
```

```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
+ └─ definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
+   └─ api.yml
+   └─ __package__.yml
```

<Callout intent = "info">
If you have an `openapi` folder and a `definition` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI specification. Remove the `openapi` folder if you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators.
