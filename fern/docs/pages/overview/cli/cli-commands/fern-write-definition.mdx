title: Convert OpenAPI to Fern Definition
description: The command "fern write-definition" converts your OpenAPI specification to a Fern Definition.
---

`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. A pre-requisite is a folder within your `fern/` folder named `openapi` that contains a `json` or `yml` file.

When ran successfully, this command produces no output in the command line, and creates a new folder within `fern/` called `definition/`.

## Usage

```bash
fern write-definition
```

```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
+ └─ definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
+   └─ api.yml
+   └─ __package__.yml
```

<Callout intent="info">
If you have an `openapi/` folder and a `definition/` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI specification. Remove the `openapi/` folder if you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators.
