## Changelog overview

### New SDK language: Ruby

The Ruby SDK Generator is available for general use! This release introduces:
- Support for strongly typed models through the use of RBS type signatures.
- Integration with the Faraday HTTP client library, enabling the use of middlewares, keep-alives, and more.
- Automated publishing of the gem on RubyGems for easy access and distribution.
 
‚Üí Check out Fern-generated Ruby SDKs for [AssemblyAI](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-ruby-sdk), [Vellum](https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-ruby), and [Merge](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-ruby-client).

### Fern Docs: On-page feedback form

Your documentation now features a feedback form where users can quickly share their opinions. They have the option to give a thumbs up (üëç) or thumbs down (üëé), along with a reason for their feedback.
- Users don't have to leave your documentation website to give feedback.
- Pre-configured reason codes and an optional space for additional comments.
- Instant notifications when you receive feedback via Slack or email.
 
‚Üí Try it on [Flatfile](https://reference.flatfile.com/overview/welcome) or [Superagent](https://docs.superagent.sh/)'s API documentation.


### SDK generator improvements

We continuously improve our SDK generators based on user feedback. To get the latest release for a generator, upgrade the version in generators.yml. [See the latest generator versions](https://github.com/fern-api/fern?tab=readme-ov-file#-generators).

#### TypeScript SDK
- **[Feature] Runtime compatibility:** The SDK defaults to node-fetch but will use the global fetch client if present. The SDK works in the following runtimes:
- Node.js 15+
- Browser
- Vercel Functions
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+
- AWS Lamdba
- **[Feature] Runtime metadata:** The SDK generator now forwards information about the runtime that it is being used in. The header X-Fern-Runtime will report the runtime (e.g., browser, Node, Deno) and the header X-Fern-Runtime-Version will report the version.
- **[Feature] Binary:** Support for sending binary as a request body, relevant for application/octet-stream content-type.

#### Python SDK
- **[Feature] Request options:** Add support for a RequestOptions object for each generated function. RequestOptions is a TypedDict, with optional fields, so there's no need to instantiate an object, just pass in the relevant keys within a dict. [Read more.](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/main/generators/python/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#0101---2024-02-14)
- **[Feature] Environment variable scanning:** If the auth scheme has environment variables specified, the generated python client will scan those environment variables. [Read more.](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/main/generators/python/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#081---2024-01-26)
- **[Compatibility] Python 3.8+:** Remove support for Python 3.7. In order to support newer versions of libraries we depend on (such as typing and typing-extensions), we have moved on to Python 3.8.

#### Go SDK
- **[Feature] Idempotency:** Idempotency headers as a RequestOption.
- **[Feature] Retry login:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff.
- **[Feature] Binary:** Support for sending binary as a request body, relevant for application/octet-stream.
- **[Feature] Date and time:** Enforce RFC3339 for date[time] serialization in request bodies.

#### Java SDK
- **[Feature] Idempotency:** Idempotency headers as a RequestOption. [Read more.](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/main/generators/java/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#071---2024-02-04)

## Detailed generator changelogs

### Go SDK generator

#### [0.17.0-rc1] - 2024-02-23

- Fix: Snippets for aliases to optional primitive values. With this, the generated snippet
  will include the top-level pointer helpers (e.g. `acme.String(...)`).

#### [0.17.0-rc0] - 2024-02-21

- Fix: Package documentation is now generated into the correct package's `doc.go`.
- Feature: Add support for generated endpoint snippets.
  - The snippets will be available in the API reference documentation, as well as the
    snippets API.
  - The snippets are _not_ embedded in the SDK itself (yet).

```go
import (
  context "context"
  time "time"
  acme "github.com/acme/acme-go"
  acmeclient "github.com/acme/acme-go/client"
  option "github.com/acme/acme-go/option"
)

client := acmeclient.NewClient(
  option.WithToken(
    "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>",
  ),
)
response, err := client.User.Create(
  context.TODO(),
  &acme.CreateUserRequest{
    Username: "john",
    Language: acme.LanguageEnglish,
    Age:      acme.Int(32),
    Birthday: acme.MustParseDate(
      "1980-06-01"
    ),
  },
)
```

#### [0.16.0] - 2024-02-12

- Feature: The generator now supports whitelabelling. When this is turned on,
  there will be no mention of Fern in the generated code.

  **Note**: You must be on the enterprise tier to enable this mode.

#### [0.15.0] - 2024-02-09

- Feature: Enforce RFC3339 for date[time] serialization in request bodies.

#### [0.14.1] - 2024-02-07

- Fix: Query parameter supoort for optional `time.Time` types.

#### [0.14.0] - 2024-02-06

- Feature: Add support for `deepObject` query parameters.
- Chore: Refactor query parameter serialization with `url` struct tags.

#### [0.13.0] - 2024-01-31

- Feature: Add `packageName` generator configuration.
- Feature: Add support for `bytes` request bodies wrapped in an in-lined request.

#### [0.12.1] - 2024-01-31

- Fix: `text/plain` response handling.

#### [0.12.0] - 2024-01-30

- Feature: Add support for `bytes` request bodies with `Content-Type` set to
  `application/octet-stream`.

#### [0.11.0] - 2024-01-29

- Feature: Add automatic retry with exponential backoff.

#### [0.10.0] - 2024-01-25

- Feature: Refactor `ClientOption` as `RequestOption`.
- Feature: Add `includeLegacyClientOptions` generator configuration.
- Feature: Support idempotency headers as a special `RequestOption` only available on
  idempotent endpoints.
- Fix: Placement of path parameter documentation.
- Fix: Naming collision issue for undiscriminated unions that define more than one
  literal.

#### [0.9.4] - 2024-01-10

- Fix: File upload requests that specify query parameters.


### Java SDK generator

#### [0.8.4] - 2024-02-23
- Improvement: The timeout specified on the RequestOptions object now sets the timeout on the entire call, not just the read timeout of the request.
  As a refresher, a timeout can be added per request like so: 
  ```java
  RequestOptions ro = RequestOptions.builder().timeout(90).build(); // Creates a timeout of 90 seconds for the request
  //  You could also specify the timeunit, similar to as if you were using OkHttp directly
  //  RequestOptions ro = RequestOptions.builder().timeout(2, TimeUnit.MINUTES).build();
  client.films.list(ro);
  ```

#### [0.8.3] - 2024-02-23
- Fix: The SDK generator now always creates a valid name for union discriminator wrapper classes.

#### [0.8.2] - 2024-02-21
- Fix: File upload endpoints no longer fail to compile because the reference to 
  the mime type variable is present.  
  
  ```java
  // Code that failed to compile
  String fileMimeType = Files.probeContentType(file.toPath());
  MediaType fileMediaType = fileMimeType != null ? MediaType.parse(mimeType) : null; // mimeType undefined
  // Code that now compiles
  MediaType fileMediaType = fileMimeType != null ? MediaType.parse(fileMimeType) : null;
  ```

#### [0.8.1] - 2024-02-14
- Feature: The RequestOptions object now supports configuring an optional timeout to apply per-request.
  ```java
  RequestOptions ro = RequestOptions.builder().timeout(90).build(); // Creates a timeout of 90 seconds for the request
  //  You could also specify the timeunit, similar to as if you were using OkHttp directly
  //  RequestOptions ro = RequestOptions.builder().timeout(2, TimeUnit.MINUTES).build();
  client.films.list(ro);
  ```

#### [0.8.0] - 2024-02-11
- Feature: The SDK generator now supports whitelabelling. When this is turned on, 
  there will be no mention of Fern in the generated code. 

  **Note**: You must be on the enterprise tier to enable this mode. 

#### [0.7.1] - 2024-02-04
- Chore: Bump intermediate representation to v31
- Feature: The SDK generator now supports idempotency headers. Users 
  will be able to specify the idempotency headers in RequestOptions.
  ```java
  Imdb imdb = Imdb.builder()
    .apiKey("...")
    .build();
  
  var response = imdb.ticket.purchase("theatre-id", IdempotentRequestOptions.builder()
    .idempotencyKey("...")
    .build());
  ```
- Feature: The SDK generator now supports scanning API credentials
  via environment varaibles. 
  ```java
  Imdb imdb = Imdb.builder()
    .apiKey("...") // defaults to System.getenv("IMDB_API_KEY")
    .build();
  ```
- Feature: The generated models now support boolean literals and users 
  do not have to specify them in the builder. 
  For example, for the following object
  ```yaml
  Actor: 
    properties: 
      name: string
      isMale: literal<true>
  ```
  the user will not need to specify the literal properties when building
  the object. 
  ```java
  var actor = Actor.builder()
    .name("Brad Pitt")
    .build();
  ```


### Postman Collection generator

#### [0.1.0] - 2024-02-11
- Fix: The Postman generator no longer times out on the latest CLI version. 
  
  The generator would previously throw on additional fields being present in the IR, which would prevent
  Fern from adding new fields. Now, the generator does not throw if additional fields are present.


### Python SDK generator

#### [0.11.6] - 2024-02-26

- Improvement: You can now specify envvars to scan for headers, not just auth scheme headers.
  ```
  # OpenAPI
  x-fern-global-headers:
   - header: x-api-key
     name: api_key
     optional: true
     env: MY_API_KEY
  ```
  ... or ...
  ```
  # Fern Definition
  getAllUsers:
    method: GET
    path: /all
    request:
      name: GetAllUsersRequest
      headers:
        X-API-KEY: string
        env: MY_API_KEY
  ```
  the generated client will look like

  ```python
  import os

  class Client:

    def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str = os.getenv("MY_API_KEY"))
  ```

#### [0.11.5] - 2024-02-23

- Fix: Fix the usage of ApiError when leveraging auth envvars, when the schema for ApiError was changed, this usage was missed in the update.

#### [0.11.4] - 2024-02-23

- Fix: We now grab enum values appropriately when enums are within unions.

#### [0.11.3] - 2024-02-22

- Fix: Transition from lists to sequences within function calls, this is a fix as a result of how mypy handles type variance.
  This fix is only for function calls as testing shows that we do not hit the same issue within mypy with list[union[*]] fields on pydantic objects.
  This issue outlines it well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76138438/incompatible-types-in-assignment-expression-has-type-liststr-variable-has

- Improvement: The Python SDK generator now defaults to `require_optional_fields = False`. This means that any requests that have optional fields no longer require a user to input data (or a `None` value) in.
  Example:

  ```python
  # Previously:
  def my_function(my_parameter: typing.Optional[str]):
    pass

  my_function()  # <--- This fails mypy
  my_function(None)  # <--- This is necessary
  my_function("I work in both cases!")
  ...
  # Now:
  def my_function():
    pass

  my_function()  # <--- I no longer fail mypy
  my_function(None)  # <--- I still work
  my_function("I work in both cases!")
  ```

#### [0.11.2] - 2024-02-21

- Improvement (Beta): The Python generator now supports a configuration option called `improved_imports`. To enable
  this configuration, just add the following to your generators.yml

  ```yaml
  generators:
    - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
      ...
      config:
        improved_imports: true
  ```

  Enabling improved imports will remove the verbose `resources` directory in the SDK and make the imports
  shorter. This will also improve the imports from Pylance and Pyright that are automaticaly generated

  ```python
  # Before
  from sdk.resources.fhir import Paient

  # After
  from sdk.fhir import Patient
  ```

#### [0.11.1] - 2024-02-20

- Improvement: Python now supports specifying files to auto-export from the root `__init__.py` file, this means you can export custom classes and functions from your package for users to access like so:

  ```python
  from my_package import custom_function
  ```

  the configuration for this is:

  ```yaml
  # generators.yml
  python-sdk:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
        version: 0.11.1
        config:
          additional_init_exports:
            - from: file_with_custom_function
              imports:
                - custom_function
  ```

- Chore: Add a docstring for base clients to explain usage, example:

  ```python
  class SeedTest:
    """
    Use this class to access the different functions within the SDK. You can instantiate any number of clients with different configuration that will propogate to these functions.
    ---
    from seed.client import SeedTest

    client = SeedTest(
        token="YOUR_TOKEN",
        base_url="https://yourhost.com/path/to/api",
    )
    """
  ```

#### [0.11.0] - 2024-02-19

- Improvement: Python now supports a wider range of types for file upload, mirroring the `httpx` library used under the hood, these are grouped under a new type `File`:

  ```python
  # core/file.py
  FileContent = typing.Union[typing.IO[bytes], bytes, str]
  File = typing.Union[
      # file (or bytes)
      FileContent,
      # (filename, file (or bytes))
      typing.Tuple[typing.Optional[str], FileContent],
      # (filename, file (or bytes), content_type)
      typing.Tuple[typing.Optional[str], FileContent, typing.Optional[str]],
      # (filename, file (or bytes), content_type, headers)
      typing.Tuple[typing.Optional[str], FileContent, typing.Optional[str], typing.Mapping[str, str]],
  ]

  ...

  # service.py
  def post(
      self,
      *,
      file: core.File,
      request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions] = None,
  ) -> None:
      """
      Parameters:
          - file: core.File. See core.File for more documentation
          - request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions]. Request-specific configuration.
      """
  ...

  # main.py
  f = open('report.xls', 'rb')
  service.post(file=f)

  # Or leveraging a tuple
  with open('largefile.zip', 'rb') as f:
    service.post(file=('largefile.zip', f))
  ...
  ```

- Fix: Python now supports API specifications that leverage lists for file upload. Previously, Fern incorrectly made all `list<file>` type requests simply `file`.

  ```python
  # service.py
  def post(
      self,
      *,
      file_list: typing.List[core.File],
      request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions] = None,
  ) -> None:
      """
      Parameters:
          - file_list: typing.List[core.File]. See core.File for more documentation
          - request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions]. Request-specific configuration.
      """
  ...

  # main.py
  f1 = open('report.xls', 'rb')
  f2 = open('page.docx', 'rb')
  service.post(file_list=[f1, f2])
  ```

#### [0.10.3] - 2024-02-19

- Fix: Several bugfixes were made to related to literal properties. If a literal is
  used as a query parameeter, header, path parameter, or request parameter, the user
  no longer has to explicitly pass it in.

  For example, the following endpoint

  ```yaml
  endpoints:
    chat_stream:
      request:
        name: ListUsersRequest
        headers:
          X_API_VERSION: literal<"2022-02-02">
        body:
          properties:
            stream: literal<true>
            query: string
  ```

  would generate the following signature in Python

  ```python
  class Client:

    # The user does not have to pass in api version or stream since
    # they are literals and always the same
    def chat_stream(self, *, query: str) -> None:
  ```

#### [0.10.2] - 2024-02-18

- Fix: The SDK always sends the enum wire value instead of the name of the enum. For example,
  for the following enum,

  ```python
  class Operand(str, enum.Enum):
    GREATER_THAN = ">"
    EQUAL_TO = "="
  ```

  the SDK should always be sending `>` and `=` when making a request.

  This affected enums used in path parameters, query parameters and any request body parameters at
  the first level. To fix, the SDK sends the `.value` attribute of the enum.

- Fix: Revert #2719 which introduced additional issues with circular references within our Python types.

#### [0.10.1] - 2024-02-14

- Improvement: Add support for a RequestOptions object for each generated function within Python SDKs. This parameter is an optional final parameter that allows for configuring timeout, as well as pass in arbitrary data through to the request. RequestOptions is a TypedDict, with optional fields, so there's no need to instantiate an object, just pass in the relevant keys within a dict!

  - `timeout_in_seconds` overrides the timeout for this specific request
  - `additional_body_parameters` are expanded into the JSON request body
  - `additional_query_parameters` are expanded into the JSON query parameters map
  - `additional_headers` are expanded into the request's header map
  - Here's an example:

    ```python
    client\
      .imdb\
      .create_movie(
        request=CreateMovieRequest(title="title", rating=4.3),
        request_options={
          "timeout_in_seconds": 99,
          "additional_body_parameters": {"another": "body parameter"},
          "additional_headers": {"another": "header"},
        }
      )
    ```

#### [0.10.0] - 2024-02-13

- Improvement: Remove support for Python 3.7. In order to support newer versions of libraries we depend on (such as typing and typing-extensions), we must move on to Python 3.8. With this change we are also able to:
  - Remove the `backports` dependency, as `cached_property` is now included within `functools`
  - Remove the upper bound dependency on Pydantic which had dropped support for Python 3.7

#### [0.9.1] - 2024-02-11

- Fix: Remove literals from SDK function signatures, as they are not modifiable for end users.

  Before:

  ```python
  def get_options(self, *, dry_run: typing_extensions.Literal[True]) -> Options:
    ...
    json=jsonable_encoder({"dryRun": dry_run}),
    ...
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  def get_options(self, *) -> Options:
    ...
    json=jsonable_encoder({"dryRun": "true"}),
  ```

- Fix: Acknowledge the optionality of a `File` property, previously we were requiring all `File` type inputs, even if they were specified as optional within the OpenAPI or Fern definition. Now, we check if the parameter is required and make the parameter optional if it is not.

#### [0.9.0] - 2024-02-11

- Feature: The SDK generator now supports whitelabelling. When this is turned on,
  there will be no mention of Fern in the generated code.

  **Note**: You must be on the enterprise tier to enable this mode.

#### [0.8.3-rc0] - 2024-01-29

- Fix: Increase recursion depth to allow for highly nested and complex examples,
  this is a temporary solution while the example datamodel is further refined.

#### [0.8.2-rc0] - 2024-01-28

- Fix: The Python SDK better handles cyclical references. In particular,
  cyclical references are tracked for undiscriminated unions,
  and update_forward_refs is always called with object references.

#### [0.8.1] - 2024-01-26

- Feature: If the auth scheme has environment variables specified,
  the generated python client will scan those environment variables.

  For example, for the following Fern Definition

  ```
  auth: APIKey
  auth-schemes:
    APIKey:
      header: X-FERN-API-KEY
      type: string
      env: FERN_API_KEY
  ```

  the generated client will look like

  ```python
  import os

  class Client:

    def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str = os.getenv("FERN_API_KEY"))
  ```

#### [0.8.0] - 2024-01-25

- Fix: Enums in inlined requests send the appropriate value.

  ```python
  class Operand(str, Enum):
    greater_than = ">"
    equal_to = "="

  # Previously the SDK would just send the operand directly
  def endpoint(self, *, operand: Operand):
    httpx.post(json={"operand": operand})

  # Now, the SDK will send the value of the enum
  def endpoint(self, *, operand: Operand):
    httpx.post(json={"operand": operand.value})
  ```


### Ruby SDK generator

#### [0.2.0] - 2024-02-20

- Improvement: Ruby enum construct now leverages class constants instead of hashes to support better autocomplete
  For example, previously enums would be constructed as:

  ```ruby
  # operand.rb
  module SeedEnumClient
    OPERAND = { greater_than: ">", equal_to: "=", less_than: "less_than" }.freeze
  end

  # main.rb
  ...
  SeedEnum::OPERAND[:equal_to]
  ```

  and are now constructed as:

  ```ruby
  # operand.rb
  module SeedEnumClient
    # Tests enum name and value can be
    # different.
    class Operand
      GREATER_THAN = ">"
      EQUAL_TO = "="
      LESS_THAN = "less_than"
    end
  end

  # main.rb
  ...
  SeedEnum::Operand::EQUAL_TO
  ```

- Improvement: Discriminated unions are no longer wrapped within a parent object, rather, any field or parameter that depends on a discriminated union now explicitly references the member types in support of better autocomplete.

- Improvement: Undiscriminated unions are no longer allowed as hashes as input to SDK functions, this is in support of better autocomplete as well.

- Feature: The generated Ruby SDKs now support idempotency headers, users may specify idempotency headers within the RequestOptions object:

  ```ruby
  imdb = Imdb::Client(api_key: "...")

  request_options = IdempotencyRequestOptions.new(
    idempotency_key: "key",
    idempotency_expiration: 60
  )

  resp = imbd.ticket.purchase(id: "", request_options: request_options)
  ```

#### [0.1.1] - 2024-02-15

- Fix: ensure the Ruby generators do not have strict dependencies on the IR. The generators have been updated to allow non breaking changes for the IR and the Fern CLI to happen without issue.

#### [0.1.0-rc0] - 2024-02-12

- Improvement: loosen the Faraday dependencies within the generated SDKs, now we are supporting Faraday 1.x, while continuing to support the same upperbound (specifically supporting the latest major version as well).
- Release a minor version as the Ruby generator is now being used in beta!

#### [0.0.6] - 2024-02-09

- Improvement: license files are now specified within the gem config if they are provided

```
generators:

    version: 0.0.6
    github:
      repository: org/repo-name
      mode: pull-request
      license: MIT
```

- Improvement: we now create a Github workflow file for publishing the gem automatically, in the presence of a publishing configuration

```
generators:
  - name:
     output:  # <-- Publishing configuration
       location: rubygems
       api-key: ${API_KEY}
       package-name: "petstore"
```

#### [0.0.5] - 2024-02-06

- This release contains no changes to the API.

- Bug fixes:
  - Syntactic error in block parameter usage: we now ensure block parameters are the final parameter for functions
  - Add properties to subpackages: previously properties on subpackages were not being exposed
  - Ensure optional properties in from_json are only parsed if present

#### [0.0.4] - 2024-02-05

- This release contains no changes to the API.

- Bug fixes: ensures files are written at the gem name path over client name, and addresses string escaping on one of the Fern headers.

### [0.0.3] - 2024-02-05

- This release contains no changes to the API.

- Bug fixes: addresses a number of typos and other issues previously contained within the generation code.

#### [0.0.2] - 2024-02-01

- Improvement: Consolidate imports into the main file for easier gem usage, as opposed to directly importing the specific file (e.g. `require "fern" vs. require "fern/types/folder_a/object"`)

- Improvement: Added `rubygems` output block to generators.yml. To publish your ruby gem, setup your generators.ym like this:

```yaml
# generators.yml

groups:
 - name: ...
    version: ...
    output:
       location: rubygems
       api-key: ${API_KEY}
       package-name: "petstore"
```

#### [0.0.1] - 2024-02-01

- Improvement: Support client generation (async and async) as well as most endpoint types (except streaming)


### TypeScript SDK generator

#### [0.11.5] - 2024-02-15

- Fix: Previously `core.Stream` would not work in the Browser. Now the generated Fern SDK 
  includes a polyfill for `ReadableStream` and uses `TextDecoder` instead of `Buffer`. 

- Feature: add in a reference markdown file, this shows a quick outline of the available endpoints, 
  it's documentation, code snippet, and parameters.

  This feature is currently behind a feature flag called `includeApiReference` and can be used 
  ```yaml
  config: 
    includeApiReference: true
  ```

#### [0.11.4] - 2024-02-15

- Fix: The `Fetcher` now supports sending binary as a request body. This is important
  for APIs that intake `application/octet-stream` content types or for folks that have
  .fernignored their and added custom utilities that leverage the fetcher.

#### [0.11.3] - 2024-02-13

- Fix: ensure SDK generator always uses `node-fetch` in Node.js environments. There is an experimental
  fetch packaged with newer versions of Node.js, however it causes unexpected behavior with
  file uploads.

#### [0.11.2] - 2024-02-13

- Fix: ensure SDK generator does not drop additional parameters from requests that perform file upload. Previously, if an endpoint had `file` inputs without additional `body` parameters, query parameters were eroniously ignored.

#### [0.11.1] - 2024-02-13

- Fix: The SDK generator no longer generates a `tsconfig.json` with `noUnusedParameters`
  enabled. This check was too strict.

#### [0.11.0] - 2024-02-13

- Feature: The SDK generator now forwards information about the runtime that it is being
  used in. The header `X-Fern-Runtime` will report the runtime (e.g. `browser`, `node`, `deno`)
  and the header `X-Fern-Runtime-Version` will report the version.

#### [0.10.0] - 2024-02-11

- Feature: The SDK generator now supports whitelabelling. When this is turned on,
  there will be no mention of Fern in the generated code.

  **Note**: You must be on the enterprise tier to enable this mode.


### Fern Docs

#### 2024-02-23

- When a language selection is changed, maintain the same visual scroll position by measuring the scroll position before and after the change.
- Added Go SDK to the code snippet language selection dropdown menu. 
- Icon is now available as a markdown component. For details on usage, see the [Icon component documentation](/fern-docs/content/component-library/icons).

#### 2024-02-22

- Added line numbers to code samples.
- Added Content-Type toggle to endpoint that supports both application/json and multipart/form-data.
