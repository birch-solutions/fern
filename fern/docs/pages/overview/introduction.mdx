description: Define your API with OpenAPI or Fern's simpler format, then generate SDKs, server boilerplate, and a documentation website with an API Reference.

Fern is a toolkit for building REST APIs. With Fern, you can generate SDKs, API documentation, and boilerplate for your backend server.

Fern is **fully compatible with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)**. Leverage your existing OpenAPI
specification to generate code and documentation through Fern.

While we are big fans of OpenAPI, we know it isn't the _easiest_ format to read and write. If you're looking for an alternative, give the [Fern Definition](/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/overview) a try.

## Fern's Magic ðŸª„

The magic of Fern is our compiler, which transforms your API definition into:

- **SDKs.** Client libraries that **feel handwritten** and are published to package managers like npm and PyPI.
- **Documentation.** A beautiful docs website with a best-in-class API Reference. Automatically sync your Postman Collection.
- **Backend boilerplate.** Server side code, such as Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot. Get compile-time validation that your endpoints are being served correctly.
