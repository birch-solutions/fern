You can add `availability` to an endpoint, type, or property within your Fern Definition.

Availability can be:
- `in-development` which means it is being worked on
- `pre-release` which represents beta 
- `deprecated` which means it will be removed in the future
- `generally-available` which means it is stable and available for use

By default, all endpoints, types, and properties are `generally-available`.
