</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) 18 or higher

## Instructions

Open the [Fern Docs Starter](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter) GitHub repository, then follow the steps below to generate your documentation. 

### Step 1: Use this template

1. From the Fern Docs Starter GitHub repository, click the `Use this template` button. You must be logged into GitHub.
2. Create a new repository. Name it anything you like; `docs` is a common naming choice.

### Step 2: Clone and open the repo in your preferred code editor

Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite code editor.

The files and folders discussed in the following steps will be inside a `fern` folder in your repository:

<CodeBlock title="Fern Docs Starter repository fern/ folder contents">
```bash
fern/
â”œâ”€ docs/
  â”œâ”€ assets/
  â”œâ”€ pages/
    â”œâ”€ sdks.mdx
    â”œâ”€ welcome.mdx
â”œâ”€ openapi/
  â”œâ”€ openapi.yaml
â”œâ”€ docs.yml
â”œâ”€ fern.config.json
â”œâ”€ generators.yml 

```
</CodeBlock>

The `openapi.yaml` file in the `openapi/` folder contains a sample OpenAPI specification (OAS) file for the Swagger Petstore API. Fern uses this file to automatically generate the API Reference section of the documentation. 

The files inside the `pages/` folder represent the other documentation pages. The `docs.yml` file sets up navigation and custom styles. To learn more about adding documentation pages and configuring `docs.yml`, see [Writing Content](/generate-docs/overview/writing-content).

### Step 3: Customize organization name

In the `fern.config.json` file, replace the placeholder organization name with your actual organization name. For example:

```json
{
    "organization": "YourOrganization",
    "version": "0.15.18"
}
```

In the `docs.yml` file, update the docs URL to match your organization's naming convention. For example:

```yml
instances:
  - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

### Step 4: Install the Fern CLI

Use the `npm` CLI command to install Fern globally.

```shell
npm install -g fern-api
```

As this is a global command, you can run it from any location. The CLI commands in the remaining steps must be run from within your repository.

### Step 5: Generate your documentation

Generate and publish your documentation with the following command:

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

You will be prompted to log in and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, you will receive a URL where you can view your published documentation. For example:

```shell
â”Œâ”€
â”‚ âœ“  your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
â””â”€
```


### Step 7: Customize your documentation

Run `fern generate --docs` after modifications to re-generate and publish your documentation site. 

To preview updates to your documentation before publishing changes, run `fern generate --docs --preview`.

To update the API Reference section:
- Update or replace the file in the `openapi` folder.

To modify the content of other documentation pages:
- Modify the Markdown pages located in the `docs/pages/` folder, such as `welcome.mdx` to update the Welcome page.

To modify page styles and navigation:
- Update the `docs.yml` file to tailor your documentation to match your brand, and to configure the navigation settings
- For more information, see [Writing Content](/generate-docs/overview/writing-content).

Fern has a built-in component library for you to use. [Explore the components.](/generate-docs/component-library/)

### Step 8: Set up a custom domain

If you wish to use a custom subdomain like `https://docs.your-organization.com` or a subpath like `https://your-organization.com/docs`, you can subscribe to the [Starter plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing). Once subscribed, update `docs.yml` with the custom domain configuration:

``` yaml
 - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.your-organization.com
```

Good luck creating beautiful and functional documentation! ðŸŒ¿
