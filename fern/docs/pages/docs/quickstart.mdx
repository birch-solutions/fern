## Let's Get Started

Open the [Fern Docs Starter](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter) GitHub repository in your code editor. The follow the steps to generate your documentation.

### Step 1: Use This Template

1. Click on the "Use this template" button.
2. Create a new repository. Name it anything you like, `docs` is a common naming choice.

### Step 2: Open in Your Preferred IDE

Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite code editor.

### Step 3: Customize Organization Name

In the fern.config.json file, replace the placeholder organization name with your actual organization name. For example:

```json
{
    "organization": "YourOrganization",
    "version": "0.15.18"
}
```

Also, in the docs.yml file, update the docs URL to match your organization's naming convention. For example:

```yml
instances:
  - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

### Step 4: Generate Your Documentation

1. Install the Fern CLI by running:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

1. Generate your documentation with the following command:

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

You will be prompted to log in and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, you will receive a URL where your documentation is published. For example:

```shell
┌─
│ ✓  your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
└─
```

### Step 5: Choose an API definition format

If you're using a [Fern Definition](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/api-definition/fern-definition/overview), you can edit the files within the [`definition`](/fern/definition/) folder.

If you're using an [OpenAPI Specification](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/api-definition/openapi/extensions), then run the command: `fern generate`. You'll see a new folder created called `openapi` that contains your spec. You can edit this spec to make it your own OR copy and paste a spec you already have. Then, delete the `definition` folder.

### Step 6: Customize Your Documentation

Next, modify the markdown pages located in the `pages` directory. You can further tailor your documentation to match your brand by adjusting settings in the `docs.yml` file.

Fern has a built-in component library for you to use. [Explore the components.](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/component-library/)

### Step 6: Set Up a Custom Domain

If you wish to use a custom domain like `docs.your-organization.com` or a subdirectory like `your-organization.com/docs`, you can subscribe to the [Starter plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing). Once subscribed, update `docs.yml` with the custom domain configuration:

``` yaml
 - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.your-organization.com
```
