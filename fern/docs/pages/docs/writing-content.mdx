## Configuring content with docs.yml

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuation file called `docs.yml`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
title: Example | Docs
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
favicon: ./images/favicon.png
```
</CodeBlock>

### Title 

The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and is shown within the browser's tab. The content of a page title is important for search engine optimization (SEO). [Read more.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp)

### Navigation

The navigation organizes your documentation in the left-side nav bar. Each section has a title and a list of contents. Contents contain a page name and a file path. The supported file types are `.md` or `.mdx`.

Let's look at a basic navigation configuration. Here we have two sections, the first is called `Introduction` that has a single page `My Page` and the second is API Reference.

<CodeBlock title="Example Navigation Config">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

### Nested Sections
If you'd like a section to toggle into more sections and pages, you can nest sections within sections. Here's an example of how it's done.
<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```mdx
navigation:
  - tab: guides
    layout:
      - section: Learn
        contents: 
          - section: Key Concepts
            contents: 
              - page: Embeddings
                path: ./docs/pages/embeddings.mdx
              - page: Prompt Engineering
                path: ./docs/pages/prompts.mdx
          - section: Generation
            contents: 
              - page: Command Nightly
                path: ./docs/pages/command.mdx
              - page: Likelihood
                path: ./docs/pages/likelihood.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

### API Reference

A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that you get your API Reference with just one line. 
Add `- api: API Reference` and Fern will take care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types, 
and errors automatically populated from your API definition. 

If you want to order your API endpoints, see how to configure your
[__package__.yml](/api-definition/fern-definition/packages#navigation) . 

### Navigation bar links

If you have links that you want to be easily accessible, you can specify a list of links in `navbar-links`. These links will appear as buttons in the top right of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Link type

A link can be `primary` or `secondary`. Primary links are designed to stand out and indicate that they are clickable with an arrow `>`. You can have one primary link.

#### Link text

A link has text which is displayed to the user.

#### Link url

A link has a URL which a user is directed to. By default, URLs open in a new browser tab.

You may want to use a trackable link in your URL. For example, if using [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters), instead of `www.example.com/login`, set the URL to `www.example.com/login?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=navbar`.

### Colors

#### Primary accent

You may specify a primary accent color using the [Hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp). The primary accent color is used in many places, including:

- to indicate the page a user is on within the navigation
- the background of a primary link button
- to underline hyperlinks
- the next and previous page navigation buttons

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Background

Just like `accentPrimary`, you can specify the background color using the [Hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
  background:
    dark: "#0d0e11"
    light: "#ffffff"
```
</CodeBlock>

### Logo

You can add your logo that will display in the top left of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Logo path

`path` specifies the image file location. The supported file types are `.png` or `.svg`.

#### Logo height

`height` sets the logo's height in pixels.

#### Logo href

`href` provides a hyperlink for the logo, often used 
to point to the website homepage. When clicked, the user will be redirected to this link.

### Favicon

Specifies the path to a favicon image, which is typically displayed in a 
browser tab or bookmark. Supported file types are `.png` and `.ico`.

## Advanced features

The following configuration options are optional and allow you to further personalize your documentation website.

### Font 

You can specify a custom font for your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="fern directory">
```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  ├─ definition/ # Alternatively, you can have an OpenAPI file
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb.yml
+ ├─ fonts
+   ├─ your-font-regular.woff2
+   ├─ your-font-bold.woff2
+   └─ another-font-regular.woff2
```
</CodeBlock>

You can reference the fonts in `docs.yml` by specifying the `path` to the font file. The supported file types are `.woff` and `.woff2`.

The `headingsFont` is used for the page title and section titles. The `bodyFont` is used for the body text. The `codeFont` is used for code blocks.

Here's an example of how to specify custom fonts:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
typography:
  headingsFont:
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2
  bodyFont:
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2
  codeFont: 
    path:  ./fonts/Roboto-Mono-Regular.woff2
```
</CodeBlock>

### Tabs

Within the navigation, you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group content together. Let's add a new tab so that we can include `Help Center` content in addition to our API Reference. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](/generate-docs/component-library/icons) from FontAwesome.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    display-name: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    display-name: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
    layout: 
      - section: Introduction
          contents: 
            - page: My Page
                path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
  - tab: help
    layout: 
      - section: Help Center
        contents: 
          - page: Contact Us
              path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

Here's an example of what the Tabs implementation looks like:
![Screenshot showing two vertically stacked tabs labeled API Reference and Help Center](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fern/tabs.png)

### Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the versions and their availability:

![A dropdown of the available versions](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/versions.png)

To add a version, specify the `display-name`, which will be visible to users, and `path`, which is a file that must be in a folder called `versions`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
versions: 
  - display-name: v1.0
      path: v1-0.yml # must be in a `versions` folder
  - display-name: v1.1
      path: v1-1.yml
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-0.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-1.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>
