title: Fern Docs Quickstart with OpenAPI
desc: In this Quickstart, use Fern's starter template with a sample API using OpenAPI to create a documentation website with an auto-generated API reference.
---

Create beautiful documentation in under 5 minutes using an OpenAPI specification (formerly Swagger). Here's [an example](https://docs.propexo.com/documentation).

## Requirements

-   Node 18 or higher
-   A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
-   Familiarity with using a CLI

## Steps

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create a new GitHub repository from our starter template

1. Log into GitHub and open our [Docs Starter with OpenAPI](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi) GitHub repository.
2. From this repository, click the **Use this template** button.
3. Choose the option to **create a new repository**. Name it `fern-docs`.

### Step 2: Clone and open the repository in your preferred code editor

Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The `fern/` folder in your repository contains these files and folders:

```yml title="fern"
â”œâ”€ docs/
  â”œâ”€ assets/
  â””â”€ pages/
    â”œâ”€ concepts.mdx
    â”œâ”€ sdks.mdx
    â””â”€ welcome.mdx
â””â”€ openapi/
  â””â”€ openapi.yaml
â”œâ”€ docs.yml
â””â”€ fern.config.json
```

The `openapi/` folder contains an `openapi.yaml` file for a sample API called Swagger Petstore. Fern uses this file to generate the API Reference section of your docs site.

The files inside the `pages/` folder are used to generate other documentation pages, such as a Welcome page. The `docs.yml` file sets up site navigation and custom styles. 

### Step 3: Customize organization name and url

In the repository that you cloned locally, open the `fern.config.json` file, which looks like this:

```json title="fern.config.json" {2}
{
  "organization": "Petstore",
  "version": "0.x.x"
}
```

Replace `"Petstore"` with your own organization name within the quotes. Spaces are permitted. Leave the `version` number unchanged.

Open the `docs.yml` file and locate the `url`, which looks like this:

```yml title="docs.yml" {2}
instances:
  - url: petstore-openapi.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

Replace `petstore-openapi` with your own organization's name. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces, and leave the rest of the URL (`.docs.buildwithfern.com`) unchanged.

<Note title="Note">If you intend to set up a custom domain later for your Fern Docs site, set the organization name to match that domain. For instance, if your custom domain is `example.com`, replace `petstore-openapi` with `example` in this step.</Note>

### Step 4: Install the Fern CLI tool

Install the Fern CLI tool globally by running:

```shell title="CLI"
npm install -g fern-api
```

<Tip title="Tip">
The above CLI command is a global command that you can run from any location. The `fern` commands in the following steps must be run from within your repository.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Generate your documentation

Run the following command:

```shell title="Fern CLI"
fern generate --docs
```

When prompted, log into and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, Fern displays the URL where you can view the published documentation. For example:

```shell title="CLI output"
â”Œâ”€
â”‚ âœ“  petstore-openapi.docs.buildwithfern.com
â””â”€
```

Instead of `petstore-openapi`, you should see the organization name that you added to `docs.yml` in Step 3.

### Step 6: Automate publishing updates

In the previous step, you used `fern generate --docs` from the command line to manually generate and publish your documentation. While it's useful for you to know how this command works, going forward, we recommend that you use Fern's CI/CD pipeline instead. 

Our CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions to automate validating, previewing, and publishing your documentation. [Visit our GitHub Actions docs](/learn/docs/publish/github-actions) to set it up before going on to the next step.

### Step 7: Customize your documentation

To modify the API Reference:

- Update the OpenAPI spec in the `openapi/` folder. 

To modify the other docs pages or add new pages:

- Update the files located in the `docs/pages/` folder, such as `welcome.mdx`. See our documentation on [how to write content with Markdown and MDX](/learn/docs/content/write-markdown).

To configure site navigation, styles, and see other configuration options:

- See [Fern Docs Configuration Overview](/learn/docs/config/overview).

To learn about Fern's built-in component library you can use in Markdown:

- See [Components](/learn/docs/components).

### Step 8: Set up a custom domain, subdomain, or subpath

If you wish to use a custom domain (such as `https://example.com`), or a subdomain or subpath on your custom domain (such as `https://docs.example.com` or `https://example.com/docs`), visit the [Custom domain](/learn/docs/config/branding/custom-domain) page. 

</Steps>

Good luck creating beautiful and functional documentation! ðŸŒ¿

## About OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)

The OpenAPI specification is a format for describing REST APIs. The specification consists of a single JSON or YAML file. OpenAPI was previously known as Swagger. Fern supports both OpenAPI (3.x) and Swagger (2.x). We refer to the specification as OpenAPI throughout our documentation.
