title: Fern | Customize colors and fonts
description: Update your docs site's colors and fonts, including its primary accent, dark and light mode backgrounds, and fonts for headings, body, and code snippets.
---

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuation file called `docs.yml`. Use this file to update the colors and fonts for your documentation site.

## Colors

#### Primary accent

You can specify a primary accent color using the [hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp). The primary accent color is used for several purposes, including:

- to indicate the page a user is on within the navigation
- as the background of a primary link button
- to underline hyperlinks
- the next and previous page navigation buttons

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Background

Just like `accentPrimary`, you can specify the background color using the [hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
  background:
    dark: "#0d0e11"
    light: "#ffffff"
```
</CodeBlock>

## Fonts

You can specify custom fonts for your documentation website. The supported file types are `.woff` and `.woff2`.

Include the custom fonts in your `fern/` project:

<CodeBlock title="Example custom fonts">
```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  ├─ openapi/
    ├─ openapi.yml
+ ├─ fonts/
+   ├─ your-font-regular.woff2
+   ├─ your-font-bold.woff2
+   └─ another-font-regular.woff2
```
</CodeBlock>

Fern has three font types:
- `headingsFont`: affects page and section titles; if not supplied, defaults to the body font
- `bodyFont`: affects paragraph text and other body text
- `codeFont`: affects code blocks and inline code snippets

To customize the font used for each font type, add a top-level `typography` list to `docs.yml`. Then in it, specify the path of your font file for one or more of the font types.

A font has two properties:
- `name`: the name of the font; defaults to a generated name that will be used to reference your custom font in the eventually injected CSS
- `path`: the path to the font file

<CodeBlock title="Example of specifying custom fonts in docs.yml">
```yaml
typography:
  bodyFont:
    name: Inter-Regular
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2
  headingsFont:
    name: Inter-Bold
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2
  codeFont: 
    name: Roboto-Mono-Regular
    path:  ./fonts/Roboto-Mono-Regular.woff2
    name: Roboto-Mono-Regular
```
</CodeBlock>

If the font file is not variable, you can specify font weights.

A font path has three properties:
- `path`: indicate that there are multiple font files
- `weight`: a string of weights that are supported by this font file
- `style`: the style of the font file, either `normal` or `italic`

<CodeBlock title="Example of specifying font weights in docs.yml">
```yaml
typography:
  bodyFont:
    name: Inter-Regular
    paths:
      - path: ./fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2
        weight: "400"
        style: normal
      - path: ./fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2
        weight: 500 900 # <-- indicates a range of weights
        style: normal
```        
</CodeBlock>
