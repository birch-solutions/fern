title: Add a custom logo and favicon
description: Customize your docs site's logo and favicon, including the logo height and its link target.

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuation file called `docs.yml`. Use this file to update the logo and favicon for your documentation site.

## Logo

Add a logo that displays in the top left of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
```
</CodeBlock>

### Logo path

`path` specifies the image file location. The supported file types are `.png` or `.svg`.

### Logo height

`height` sets the logo's height in pixels.

### Logo href

`href` provides a link for the logo, often used 
to point to the website's homepage. When the logo is clicked, the user is directed to this link.

## Favicon

Specifies the path to a `favicon` image, which is typically displayed in a 
browser tab or bookmark. Supported file types are `.png` and `.ico`.
