title: Fern | Indicate the Availability of an endpoint
description: Indicate the status of a feature using the Availability component. Display a tag of beta, generally available, or deprecated. 
---

The `Availability` component is used to indicate the availability status of a feature, such as an endpoint. This component renders as a tag within your documentation.

Within the API reference documentation that's generated using Fern Docs, use [Fern Definition `availability`](/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/availability) property or the [OpenAPI extension `x-fern-availability`](/overview/define-your-api/openapi/extensions) instead to indicate availability. 

In the Markdown pages that make up the rest of your documentation site, use the `Availability` component as shown below to manually render the tag.

Availability prop:

**type**: 'beta' | 'GA' | 'deprecated'

## Beta availability 

Indicates that a feature is in <Availability type="beta" />. This means that the feature is still in development and may change before it is released to the public. 

```mdx
<Availability type="beta" />
```

## General availability

Indicates that a feature is <Availability type="GA" />. This means that the feature is ready for use in production. 

```mdx
<Availability type="GA" />
```

## Deprecated availability

Indicates that a feature is <Availability type="deprecated" />. This means that the feature is no longer supported and will be removed in a future release.

```mdx
<Availability type="deprecated" />
```
