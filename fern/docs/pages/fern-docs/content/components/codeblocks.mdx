title: Display code in tabs with CodeBlocks
description: Use the CodeBlocks component to show multiple code snippets in a tabbed view.
---

The `CodeBlocks` component is used to display multiple code snippets in a tabbed view. It does not take any props.

Within the `CodeBlocks` component, use [Markdown fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) along with a title and optional [syntax highlighting](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting). Please refer to Fern's [Code snippets](/docs/content/code-snippets) guide for a full list of highlighting features.

<Note>
The `CodeBlock` component (singular) is deprecated in favor of using Markdown fenced code blocks. The `CodeBlock` component was previously used to add a title to a fenced code block, but Fern now supports setting the title directly on the code block instead. If you used `CodeBlock` in your docs before, it will continue to work, but we recommend that you phase out its use.
</Note>

## Usage

<Warning>
  For fenced code blocks inside a `CodeBlocks` component, be sure to set their `title` to give descriptive titles to the tabs. Otherwise, the tabs by default display `Untitled`.
</Warning>

Example:

````mdx
<CodeBlocks>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeBlocks>
````

This renders as:

<CodeBlocks>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeBlocks>
