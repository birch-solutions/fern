title: Fern | Write content for your Fern Docs using Markdown and MDX
description: Use Markdown and MDX to add content to your Fern documentation site, including Fern's built-in component library.
---

## Add Markdown or MDX pages

Add pages manually to your documentation by creating Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files. New to Markdown? See [Markdown Guide: Getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

Place your pages inside your `fern/` folder and link to them from your [navigation settings](/fern-docs/config/navigation) in the `docs.yml` file.

In the example below, the MDX files are inside a folder named `pages/`.

<CodeBlock title="Example folder structure">
```bash
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ docs.yml
└─ pages/
  ├─ welcome.mdx
  └─ quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yml
navigation:
  - section: Overview
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./pages/welcome.mdx
      - page: Quickstart
        path: ./pages/quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

## Fern components
Fern has a built-in component library you can use in Markdown and MDX files. [Explore the components.](/fern-docs/content/component-library/)

## Links in Markdown and MDX

### Link target
When clicked, links to relative URLs open in the same tab, whereas links to absolute URLs open in a new browser tab. 

### Link format
Use a `/` character to begin a relative URL to another page on your docs site. This routes to the `url` defined in your `docs.yml` file, such as `example-docs.buildwithfern.com`. For example, if you want to link to `https://example-docs.buildwithfern.com/overview/introduction`, you can write the link in Markdown/MDX as follows:

<CodeBlock title="Relative link example">
```mdx
Read the [Introduction](/overview/introduction).
```
