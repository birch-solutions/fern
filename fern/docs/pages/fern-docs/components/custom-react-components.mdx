title: Custom React components
description: Use React to create custom components for your Fern Docs site, such as header and footer components.
---
{/* This is a starter page for documenting custom React components. It has not yet been added to docs.yml. Please remove this comment once it has been added to docs.yml.*/}

Using a custom React app, Fern makes it possible to create custom components to insert into your Fern Docs.

<Note title="Note">
The approach demonstrated on this page is subject to change as we make improvements to the plugin architecture.
</Note>

## Try out the custom-app example on GitHub

This example builds custom `NavHeader` and `NavFooter` components on top of Fern's [docs-starter-openapi](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi/) GitHub template.

## Requirements
- Node 18 or above
- Yarn
- [Fern CLI](/learn/overview/cli/overview)

## Steps
<Steps>

### Step 1: Clone the example repository

Clone the [example repository](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-custom-js-example/tree/main).

### Step 2: Update site configuration files

In the `fern/` folder:
- Update the organization name in `fern.config.json` to your own.
- Set a unique testing `url` in `docs.yml`. Example:

```yaml
instances:
  - url: YOUR_NAME-custom-app-example.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

In your cloned repository, enter the `custom-app/` folder and install the project dependencies with Yarn:

```shell
cd custom-app
yarn 
```

### Step 4: Build the app and generate docs

From the `custom-app/` folder, run:

```shell
yarn build
fern generate --docs 
```

### Step 5: View the docs site

Visit the generated docs site URL and view the `NavHeader` and `NavFooter` components. 

</Steps>

## Important notes

If you build your own custom React components based on this example, note that:

- `ReactDOM.render()` may need to be called multiple times to prevent it from unmounting. This side-effect will be removed in the future.
- `yarn build` or `npm build` must output `dist` files with deterministic names. This example uses this vite config to accomplish it. Then, reference the js/css files in `docs.yml` to get picked up by Fern Docs.
- You may need to update your CD steps to include building the React app. 
- If you use Tailwind, make sure to prefix the Tailwind classes and disable preflight to prevent conflicts with Fern's stylesheet.
