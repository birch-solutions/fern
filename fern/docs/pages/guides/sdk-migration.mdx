In this guide, we'll walk through the process of migrating from an old SDK to a new Fern SDK.

## Versioning 

We recommend publishing a new major [version](https://semver.org/). This was, you can maintain backwards compatibility with your old SDK and allow users to migrate at their own pace.

## Python and PyPi

Python supports beta releases so if you append the release with a `-beta0` that will create a pre-release. This way, you do not break any end users of your SDK.
