`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. A pre-requisite is a folder within your Fern directory named `openapi` that contains a `json` or `yml` file.

## Usage

```bash
$ fern write-definition
```

Once ran, you'll see a new folder called `definition` created:

```diff
fern/
 ├─ fern.config.json
 ├─ generators.yml
 └─ openapi/
   └─ openapi.json
+└─ definition/ # <--- your Fern Definition
+  └─ api.yml
+  └─ __package__.yml
```

The files within `definition` will vary based on the contents of your OpenAPI Specification.

<Callout intent="warn">
  When you have an `openapi` folder and a `definition` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI spec. Remove the
  `openapi` folder if you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators.
</Callout>
