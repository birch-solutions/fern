`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. You'll see a new folder called `definition` created.

When successfully executed, this command will not produce any output, indicating it has run without issues.

## Usage

```bash
fern write-definition
```

```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
+ └─ definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
    └─ api.yml
    └─ __package__.yml
```

When you have an `openapi` folder and a `definition` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI spec. Remove the `openapi` folder if you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators.
