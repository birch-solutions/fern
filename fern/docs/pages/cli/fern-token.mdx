Use `fern token` to generate a `FERN_TOKEN` that is specific to your organization that is defined in `fern.config.json`. Use the token to authenticate with the API in CI. Tokens do not expire.

## Usage

```bash
fern token
```

## GitHub Actions

If using GitHub Actions as your CI, add the `FERN_TOKEN` as a GitHub Action secret in the repo where your Fern configuration is stored. Here are [instructions for how to create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) for a repo.

You can then reference the secret in your CI, for [example](https://github.com/fern-api/docs/blob/744bf283824025343a2bdcbbf2f3391a3144cc26/.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml#L25C26-L25C26):

```yaml
- name: Generate and Publish Documentation with Fern
env:
    FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
run: fern generate --docs
```
