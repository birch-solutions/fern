`fern init` initialize a new Fern workspace in the current folder. By default, you'll see the `IMDb API` (Internationa; Movie Database) example.

## Usage

```bash
fern init
```

This will create the following folder structure in your project:

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
    └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```

## Options

By adding `--docs`, you'll also get a sample documentation website for your API with an API Reference section.

```bash
$ fern init --docs
```

The file added will look like:

<CodeBlock title = "docs.yml">
```yml
instances:
  - url: https://your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
title: Your Organization | Documentation
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
colors:
  accentPrimary: '#ffffff'
  background: '#000000'
```

To see what the API docs looks like, run `fern generate --docs`. More details on this command are available [here](/fern-generate).
