`fern init` adds a new API to your project. By default, you'll see a sample API for the `IMDb` (International Movie Database) added to your repository.

## Usage

```bash
$ fern init
```

The file structure will look like:

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/ # sample API definition
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb.yml
```

## Options

By adding `--docs`, you'll also get a sample documentation website for your API with an API Reference section.

```bash
$ fern init --docs
```

The file added will look like:

<CodeBlock title = "docs.yml">
```yml
instances:
  - url: https://<your-organization>.docs.buildwithfern.com
title: <your-organization> | Documentation
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
colors:
  accentPrimary: '#ffffff'
  background: '#000000'
```

To see what the API docs looks like, run `fern generate --docs`. More details on this command are available [here](/fern-generate).
