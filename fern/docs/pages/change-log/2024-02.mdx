## On-Page Feedack
*February 6th, 2024*

We've launched an on-page feedback feature enabling users to express their opinions with a 👍 or 👎, accompanied by a reason for their feedback. This empowers documentation authors to pinpoint underperforming pages and correct errors, such as malformed code examples. Authors receive instant notifications of new feedback through Slack, email, or RSS.
