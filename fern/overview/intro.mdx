**Fern is a toolkit for improving API developer experience.** Fern reads your API Definition (e.g. OpenAPI) 
and generates documentation, SDKs, and server-side code.

- **Docs:** A beautiful docs website that can be customized to match your brand. 
- **SDKs:** Client libraries in multiple languages that stay in sync with your API. 
- **Server-side code generation:** Generate boilerplate on the server
  side, like Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot.
