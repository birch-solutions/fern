description: Learn how to set up your Fern-generated documentation site to use a custom subdomain or subpath.

Bring Fern Docs to your custom domain.

You can use:
- A subdomain on your custom domain, such as `docs.example.com`
- A subpath on your custom domain, such as `example.com/docs`

<Tip>This feature is available on the Starter plan and above. [Contact us](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) to get set up.</Tip>

## Option 1: Subdomain

To host your documentation on a subdomain, i.e. `docs.mydomain.com`, you need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings.

<Steps>

### Create a CNAME record

1. Log in to your domain registrar's dashboard.
2. Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
3. Add a new CNAME record with the following details:
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name**: `docs` (or any subdomain you want to use)
   - **Value**: `cname.vercel-dns.com.`

### Update the domain in `docs.yml`

```yaml
instances:
 - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.mydomain.com
```

Merge your changes into `main`. [Here's an example](https://github.com/octoml/fern-config/blob/389b67679953856ba0716537981a6d749635556f/fern/docs.yml#L1-L3 ).

### Reach out to us

Once you've completed the above steps, ask a member of the Fern team to complete the setup on our end.

If you have an existing project in Vercel, we may need you to verify our access to your subdomain via a TXT record, which we'll provide you with.

### Verify the setup

Once we've completed the setup on our end, you should be able to access your documentation at `docs.mydomain.com`. SSL will be automatically provisioned for your domain, but it may take a few minutes to propagate globally.

</Steps>

## Option 2: Subpath

## Steps

<Steps>

### Step 1: Open `docs.yml`

Open the `docs.yml` file, which lives in the `fern/` folder of your Fern Docs repository.

### Step 2: Configure the `url`

Append that subpath to the end of the `url`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml example for subpath">
```yaml
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs
```
</CodeBlock>

<Tip>This use `docs` for the subpath specified in `custom-domain`, but you can use any word you like, such as `reference` or `learn`.</Tip>

### Step 3: Configure the `custom-domain`

Below the `url`, add a `custom-domain` key as shown in the examples below.

<CodeBlock title="Custom subpath">
```yaml 
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs
    custom-domain: example.com/docs
```
</CodeBlock>

[Here's an example.](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/7d8631c6119787a8aaccb4ba49837e73c985db28/fern/docs.yml#L1-L3)

### Step 4: Update the Fern Docs site

If you created your Fern Docs site using one of our [Docs Quickstarts](/learn/docs/getting-started/quickstart), push the changes you made to your GitHub repository. This runs a GitHub Action to update the site with your new configuration.

If you need to update your Fern Docs site manually, run `fern generate --docs`.

### Step 5: Create DNS records to point at Fern Docs

This feature is available on the Fern Docs Starter plan and above. Reach out to [sales@buildwithfern.com](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com) to set up your subscription and obtain DNS records information for your domain registrar.
