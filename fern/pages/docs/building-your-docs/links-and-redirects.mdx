## Redirects

The `redirects` object allows you to redirect traffic from one path to another. You can also use [`regex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) within redirects. 

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yml
redirects:
  - source: "/old-path"
    destination: "/new-path"
  - source: "/incorrect/path"
    destination: "/correct/path"
  - source: "/old-folder/:slug" # <- using regex
    destination: "/new-folder/:slug"
```
</CodeBlock>
