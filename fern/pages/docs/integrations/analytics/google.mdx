Fern supports integrating with both [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/). Follow the steps below to configure these services.

## Google Analytics 4

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a Google Analytics 4 property ID. This ID is typically in the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`.

### Integration Steps

1. Open your docs.yml file.
2. Add your Google Analytics 4 property ID under the `measurement-id` key.
3. Verify data in Google Analytics. Note that it may take 24–48 hours for website traffic data to start appearing.

Example configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  ga4:
    measurement-id: G-XXXXXXXXXX
```
</CodeBlock>

## Google Tag Manager

### Prerequisites

To use Google Tag Manager, obtain a container ID from your Google Tag Manager account. This ID follows the format `GTM-XXXXXX`.

### Integration Steps

1. Open your docs.yml file.
2. Add your Google Tag Manager container ID under the container-id key.
3. Verify data in Google Analytics. Note that it may take 24–48 hours for website traffic data to start appearing.

Example configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  gtm:
    container-id: GTM-XXXXXXX
```
</CodeBlock>
