Fern supports integrating with both [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/). 

## Google Analytics 4

To integrate Google Analytics 4, you'll need a Google Analytics 4 property ID. It should look like: “UA-XXXXXX-X” or "G-XXXXXXX."

### Integrate Google Analytics 4 with your Docs

In your `docs.yml` file, add your Google Analytics 4 property ID under the `measurement-id` key:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  ga4:
    measurement-id: ${GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID} # scans environment variable
```
</CodeBlock>

## Google Tag Manager

To integrate Google Tag Manager, you'll need a Google Tag Manager container ID. It should look like: "GTM-XXXXXX."

### Integrate Google Tag Manager with your Docs

In your `docs.yml` file, add your Google Tag Manager container ID:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  gtm:
    container-id: ${GTM_CONTAINER_ID} # scans environment variable
```
</CodeBlock>
