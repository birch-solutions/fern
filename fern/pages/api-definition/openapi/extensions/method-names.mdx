title: Customize SDK Method Names
description: Use `x-fern-sdk-method-name` and `x-fern-sdk-group-name` to finetune SDK naming.
---

<Note>
  The `x-fern-sdk-group-name` and `x-fern-sdk-method-name` extensions allow you to customize the generated SDK method
  names.
</Note>

## Usage

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.create()` for the `POST /users` endpoint.

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

## Top level methods

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the root.
In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /send:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```

## Multiple levels of nesting

If you add more than one `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK will nest group names.
The order of the group names is preserved in the generated SDK method.

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.notifications.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users/notifications:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name:
        - users
        - notifications
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```
