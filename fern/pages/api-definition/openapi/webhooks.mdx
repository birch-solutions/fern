title: Define Webhooks in OpenAPI
subtitle: Use the `x-fern-webhook` extension to define webhooks in your OpenAPI spec
---

THere are a couple different ways you can model Webhooks in OpenAPI. 

## Use the `x-fern-webhook` extension

Simply define a path in your OpenAPI, and add the extension `x-fern-webhook`. Fern will 
read the `requestBody` and ignore the rest. 

```yaml openapi.yml
paths: 
  /payment/updated/: 
    post: 
      summary: Payment Initiated
      x-fern-webhook: true
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                amount:
                  type: number
                currency:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Currency'
              required:
                - amount
                - currency 
```
