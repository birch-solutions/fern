## 0.12.0
**`(feat):`** The SDK now generates tests leveraging auto-generated data to test typing, as well as wire-formatting (e.g. the SDKs are sending and receiving data as expected). This comes out of the box within the generated github workflow, as well as through the fern cli: `fern test --command "your test command"`.
  **Note**: You must be on the enterprise tier to enable this mode.
