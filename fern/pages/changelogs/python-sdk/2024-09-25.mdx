## 4.2.7-rc2
**`(fix):`** When sending Snippet Templates back to Fern, the generator will not try to coerce a potentially missing ID into the `api_definition_id` field.
This, had been a cause of the error log `Failed to upload snippet templates to FDR, this is ok: one of the hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int arguments must be given`.
