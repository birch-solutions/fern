## 0.11.2
**`(fix):`** The Python generator now supports a configuration option called `improved_imports`. To enable
  this configuration, just add the following to your generators.yml

  ```yaml
  generators:
    - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
      ...
      config:
        improved_imports: true
  ```

  Enabling improved imports will remove the verbose `resources` directory in the SDK and make the imports
  shorter. This will also improve the imports from Pylance and Pyright that are automaticaly generated

  ```python
  # Before
  from sdk.resources.fhir import Paient

  # After
  from sdk.fhir import Patient
  ```
