## 0.32.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `inlineFileProperties` configuration option, which generates file properties in the generated request type instead of as separate positional parameters.

**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where the new `core.MultipartWriter` was generated for SDKs that didn't define any file upload endpoints.

**`(internal):`** Simplify the generated code from the new `core.MultipartWriter` introduced in 0.29.0 by refactoring `internal.WithMultipartContentType` as `internal.WithDefaultContentType`.
