## WebSocket Support
Added WebSocket support to API Playground for testing real-time endpoints.

```typescript
// Testing WebSocket endpoints in playground
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};
```

## Java UTF-8 Support
Added proper UTF-8 encoding support for Java SDK file operations.

```java
// Automatic UTF-8 handling
String content = client.files.readTextFile("document.txt");
client.files.writeTextFile("новый.txt", "Hello, 世界!");
```

## Version Navigation
Improved version selector and navigation in documentation.

```yaml
# versions.yml
versions:
  - label: v2.0 (Latest)
    path: /v2
  - label: v1.0
    path: /v1
```
