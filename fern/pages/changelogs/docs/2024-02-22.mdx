## WebSocket Support in API Playground
Added real-time WebSocket testing capabilities to the API playground, enabling developers to test streaming and real-time endpoints directly in the documentation. WebSocket connections can now be established, tested, and debugged without leaving the docs.

```typescript
// WebSocket playground configuration
const wsConfig = {
  endpoint: 'wss://api.example.com',
  protocols: ['v1', 'v2'],
  onMessage: (event) => {
    console.log('Received:', event.data);
  }
};
```

## Enhanced Code Highlighting
Implemented a new code highlighting system using Shiki for improved syntax highlighting accuracy and performance. The system now supports more languages and provides better dark mode compatibility.

```yaml
# Code block configuration
highlight:
  theme: 'github-dark'
  languages: ['typescript', 'python', 'go', 'ruby']
  inline: true
```

## Feedback System
Introduced a new feedback collection system using Radix UI components for improved accessibility. Users can now provide structured feedback about documentation quality and usefulness directly within the interface.

```typescript
interface FeedbackForm {
  helpful: boolean;
  category?: 'clarity' | 'accuracy' | 'completeness';
  details?: string;
}
```

## Layout Configuration System
Implemented a flexible layout configuration system that allows for custom header, footer, and sidebar arrangements. Documentation can now be customized to match your brand and preferences.

```yaml
layout:
  header:
    position: 'fixed'
    height: 'auto'
  sidebar:
    width: 280
    collapsible: true
```

## Custom Styling Support
Added support for custom CSS and scripts, enabling deep customization of documentation appearance and behavior. Organizations can now apply their branding consistently across their documentation.
