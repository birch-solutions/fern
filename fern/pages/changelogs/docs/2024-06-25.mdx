# June 2024

## RSS Feed Integration
Added support for RSS and Atom feeds to keep users updated on documentation changes. Teams can now offer automated update notifications for their documentation.

```yaml
rss:
  enabled: true
  title: "API Documentation Updates"
  description: "Latest changes and updates"
  categories:
    - name: breaking-changes
      priority: high
    - name: new-features
      priority: medium
```

## JSON-LD Enhancement
Implemented structured data support through JSON-LD for improved SEO. Documentation pages now provide richer information to search engines and social platforms.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "TechArticle",
  "headline": "API Authentication Guide",
  "datePublished": "2024-06-15",
  "technicalAudience": "Software Developers"
}
```

## Image Zoom Controls
Added configurable image zoom functionality with custom triggers and behaviors. Users can now better examine diagrams and technical illustrations in documentation.

```typescript
const zoomConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  background: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
  excludeClass: 'no-zoom',
  maxScale: 4
}
```

## Syntax Extension Support
Added support for additional syntax highlighting languages including BAML and Jinja. Documentation can now properly display a wider range of code examples.

```typescript
const syntaxConfig = {
  languages: {
    baml: {
      source: 'custom',
      aliases: ['buildaml']
    },
    jinja: {
      source: 'prismjs',
      dependencies: ['python']
    }
  }
}
```
