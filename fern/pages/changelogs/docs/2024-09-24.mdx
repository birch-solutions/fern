## gRPC Endpoint Support
Added support for calling gRPC endpoints through the proxy.

```protobuf
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User) {}
}
```

## Editable API Playground
Test different API environments directly in the documentation playground.

```yaml
environments:
  production: api.example.com
  staging: api-staging.example.com
```

## Java Streaming Support
Stream large file uploads and downloads in Java SDK.

```java
try (InputStream fileStream = client.files.download("file-id")) {
    Files.copy(fileStream, Paths.get("downloaded-file.pdf"));
}
```
