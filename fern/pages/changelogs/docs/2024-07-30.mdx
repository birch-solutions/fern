## OSS Workspace Settings
Fixed settings propagation for APIs with dependencies in open-source workspaces.

```yaml
# workspace.yml
dependencies:
  common-types: ../common-types
  auth-api: ../auth
propagateSettings: true
```

## Extended Properties Support
Added support for extended properties in API definitions.

```yaml
types:
  User:
    properties:
      name: string
      email: string
    x-fern-extended:
      audit: true
      validation: strict
```

## Documentation Images
Added support for images in frontmatter and better image handling.

```yaml
---
title: API Overview
image: ./assets/api-diagram.png
og:image: https://yourapi.com/images/og-card.png

```
