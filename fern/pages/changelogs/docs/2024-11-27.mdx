## Auto-populate credentials in API Explorer

Save developers the hassle of finding and copying their API key. When authenticated, their API credentials will be automatically filled into the API Playground. This way, they can make their first API call even faster.

## API Group Organization
Group API endpoints logically using new OpenAPI extensions.

```yaml
/create-payment:
  post:
    x-fern-group-name: Payments
    x-fern-availability: stable
```

## OpenAPI Null Examples
Added support for null values in OpenAPI examples for better documentation.

```yaml
components:
  examples:
    UserResponse:
      value:
        name: "John Doe"
        middle_name: null
```

## Python SDK Documentation
Added comprehensive inline code documentation to Python SDKs.

```python
def create_user(name: str, role: str = "user") -> User:
    """Create a new user.
    
    Examples:
        client.users.create_user("Jane", role="admin")
    """
```
