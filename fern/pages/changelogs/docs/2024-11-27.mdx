## Auth token autocompletion in API Explorer

Auth tokens are now automatically injected into API explorer after authenticating to your API.

### Why it matters?
- Saves time for your users by automatically filling in API keys, reducing manual input.
- Minimizes errors during authentication and more usage of your API
