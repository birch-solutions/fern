title: fern token
description: The command "fern token" starts a mock server for an API. 
---

Use `fern token `to generate a `FERN_TOKEN` that is specific to your organization that is defined 
in `fern.config.json`. Use the token to authenticate with the API in CI. Tokens do not expire.

```bash 
fern token
```

## GitHub Actions

If using GitHub Actions as your CI, add the `FERN_TOKEN` as a GitHub Action secret in the repo where your 
Fern configuration is stored. Here are 
[instructions for how to create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) for a repo.

You can then reference the secret in your CI. Example:

```yaml
- name: Generate and Publish Documentation with Fern
env:
    FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
run: fern generate --docs
```

See [the full example on GitHub](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml).
