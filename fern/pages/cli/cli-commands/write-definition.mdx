description: The command "fern write-definition" converts your OpenAPI specification to a Fern Definition.
---

The `fern write-definition` command converts your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. To use it, you must have a `fern/openapi/` folder that contains an OpenAPI specification file in `json` or `yaml` format.

When run, this command creates a new folder within `fern/` called `.definition/`. 

<Warning>
Folders with names that begin with `.` are often treated as hidden. If you do not see the newly created `.definition/` folder, make sure to use the appropriate command or configuration to view hidden folders. For example, in bash or zsh, use the command `ls -a` to view all contents of the `fern/` folder instead of `ls`.
</Warning>

Run this command from within your `fern/` folder:

```bash
fern write-definition
```

```diff {6-8}
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
+ └─ .definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
+   └─ api.yml
+   └─ __package__.yml
```

If your `fern/` folder contains both an `openapi/` and a `definition/` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI specification. If you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators instead of OpenAPI, you must:
- Rename the `.definition/` folder to `definition/`.
- Remove or rename the `openapi/` folder. For example, you can rename it to `.openapi/`. 

<Tip>
You can convert Fern Definition files back to OpenAPI at any time using our [OpenAPI generator](/fern-sd-ks/other-generators/spec/openapi). Whether you want to switch back, or you need an OpenAPI specification for use with other tools, you're never locked in.
