description: The command "fern write-definition" converts your OpenAPI specification to a Fern Definition.
---

The `fern write-definition` command converts your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. To use it, you must have a `fern/openapi/` folder that contains an OpenAPI specification file in `json` or `yaml` format.

```bash
fern write-definition
```

When run, this command creates a new folder within `fern/` called `.definition/`. 

```diff {6-8}
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
+ └─ .definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
+   └─ api.yml
+   └─ __package__.yml
```

<Warning>
If you do not see the newly created `.definition/` folder, use the appropriate command or configuration to view hidden folders (`ls -a` in `bash` and `zsh`).
</Warning>

If your `fern/` folder contains both an `openapi/` and a `definition/` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI specification. If you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators instead of OpenAPI, you must:
- Rename the `.definition/` folder to `definition/`.
- Remove or rename the `openapi/` folder. For example, you can rename it to `.openapi/`. 

## Options

### api

Use `--api` to specify the API to write the definition for if you have multiple defined in your `fern/apis/` folder. 

```bash
fern write-definition --api public-api
```
