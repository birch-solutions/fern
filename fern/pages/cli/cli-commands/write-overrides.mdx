description: The command "fern write-overrides" generates a basic OpenAPI overrides file.
---

Use `fern write-overrides` to generate a basic OpenAPI overrides file. An overrides file allows for 
reversible revisions to the API specification, including adding request and response examples for Fern Docs.

When run, this command creates a new file within `fern/openapi/` called `openapi-overrides.yml`. 

```diff {5}
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
+   └─ openapi-overrides.yaml <--- your overrides file
    └─ openapi.json
```

```bash
fern write-overrides
```

## Options

### api

Use `--api` to specify the API to run the command on if multiple are defined.  

```bash
fern write-overrides --api public-api
```

### exclude-models

Use `--exclude-models` to stub the models while generating the initial overrides (in addition to the endpoints).

```bash
fern write-overrides --exclude-models
```
