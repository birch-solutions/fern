title: fern mock
description: The command "fern mock" starts a mock server for an API. 
---

Use `fern mock` to start a mock server for your API. 

```bash
fern mock
```

Fern will use your API Definition to generate a mock server that will be used in the integration tests. 
The mock server will assert that the SDK is making the correct requests.

By default, the mock server will use the examples specified in your API Definition. 
If no examples are specified, Fern will generate examples to the best of its ability.

For more information on testing Fern SDKs, see [Integration Tests](/learn/sdks/features/integration-tests).

<Note>
Specifying examples in your API Definition is recommended to ensure so that you can control what data is used in the tests.
</Note>

## Options

### api

Use `--api` to specify the API to serve if you have multiple defined in your `fern/apis/` folder. 

```bash
fern mock --api public-api
```

### port

Use `--port` to specify the port the mock server will be run on. 

```bash
fern mock --port 57908
```
