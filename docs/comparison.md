# How is Fern different than OpenAPI (f.k.a Swagger)?

1. Higher quality code generation: Fern is more restrictive in what you can model, enabling idiomatic, easy to use code generation.

2. Protocol agnostic: Fern let's you define RESTful services alongside WebSocket subscriptions.

3. Managed code generation: Fern runs code generators remotely and manages publishing packages to registries (e.g., npm, maven, pypi). You get a dependency that you can start using right away.

4. Simple CLI: Fern has one CLI with a handful of commands that's downloadable via `npm`.
