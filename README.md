# Fern

Fern keeps your docs and SDKs in sync with your API.

**Fern** allows you to maintain a single source of truth for your API so that you can:

1. **Generate idiomatic SDKs** in the most popular languages: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, Go. Fern also handles publishing to registries.
2. **Serve your API accurately**. Fern integrates with popular frameworks like Express, FastAPI, and Spring to add compile-time and run-time checks.
3. **Auto-update** your API documentation, Postman collection, and OpenAPI spec any time your API changes.

We’re in private beta with a handful of customers. If you’re interested in using Fern, [**reach out**](mailto:hey@buildwithfern.com?subject=%5BPrivate%20beta%5D%20Interest%20in%20joining).
