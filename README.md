**Fern is an open source format for defining REST APIs.**
You can think of it like a programming language to describe
your API: your endpoints, types, errors, and examples.

This repository contains the **Fern compiler.** The compiler transforms the API description into useful outputs, like:

### SDKs

Client libraries speed up internal developement, and help acquire customers who use your API. Our auto-generated SDKs are idiomatic and feel handwritten.

[Java SDK generator ➚](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-java)

### Server-side code generation.

We automatically generate lots of boilerplate on the server side, like Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot. We also add compile-time validation that all your endpoints are being served correctly.

### Postman Collection

Complete with examples of successful and unsuccessful requests!

### An OpenAPI spec

You can feed the generated OpenAPI into the endless list of tools that support OpenAPI.
