Define your API in Fern to generate boilerplate server code, SDKs, API documentation, an OpenAPI definition, and a Postman Collection.

Inspired by Google's gRPC, Amazon's Smithy, and Palantir's Conjure, **we built Fern to productize schema-first API automation**.

With **Fern** you can:

1. **Serve your API accurately**. Fern integrates with popular frameworks like Express, FastAPI, and Spring to add compile-time and run-time checks.
2. **Generate idiomatic SDKs** in the most popular languages: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Ruby. Fern also handles publishing to registries.
3. **Auto-update** your API documentation, Postman collection, and OpenAPI description any time your API changes.

We’re in private beta. If you’re interested in using Fern, [**reach out**](mailto:hey@buildwithfern.com?subject=%5BPrivate%20beta%5D%20Interest%20in%20joining).
