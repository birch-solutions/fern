# Fern

Fern is an open source toolkit for designing, building and consuming REST APIs. With Fern, you can generate client libraries, documentation and boilerplate for your backend server in your chosen framework (e.g. FastAPI, Express).

Fern can be used in your existing projects through OpenAPI or if you choose, you can describe your API in the Fern specification. In this sense, Fern is an alternative to the OpenAPI standard but does not aim to replace it.

Fern takes care of the boilerplate associated with developing APIs, so you can **focus on delivering value**.

# Capabilities

Currently, the Fern compiler can generate the following types of artifacts:

### ðŸŒ¿ Client Libraries and SDKs

Whether you call them SDKs, client libraries, bindings, or wrappers, Fern generates idiomatic SDKs you can use to interact with your APIs, or publish for third party usage. This makes keeping your client libraries up to date with your API endpoints trivial, and speeds up your workflows dramatically.

Currently, the following languages are supported:

- TypeScript
- Java
- Python
- Go

If you'd like to see a language supported, head over to [the Fern issues page](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues) and vote for the language you'd like to see supported next.

### ðŸŒ¿ Backend Code

Define your API, and Fern will generate models, endpoints and boilerplate application code. All the generated code is validated at build time, ensuring your all your endpoints and their data are being served correctly.

We currently supported:

- Express
- Spring Boot
- FastAPI

### ðŸŒ¿ Documentation

Fern provides first class support for generating documentation, ranging from [fully features documentation websites](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/generate) to Postman Collections. This allows you to always keep your documentation, API and Postman collections in sync with ease.

## Fern and OpenAPI

We have designed Fern to complement existing OpenAPI toolchains and workflows, rather than replace them. We believe OpenAPI does a good job at as a declarative standard for defining APIs, but at times it is too verbose and complex, which harms the quality of automatically generated code.

The goal of Fern is to be **complimentary to OpenAPI**, not to replace it. As such, you are never locked in to Fern, its specifications, or its tools.

If you want to read more about where Fern and OpenAPI differ, read [ï»¿Fern vs. OpenAPI](https://buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi) for an in-depth comparison.

**TL;DR: we differ from OpenAPI in these areas:**

- [New features in specification](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi#new-features-in-specification)
- [Quality of code generation](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi#quality-of-code-generation)
- [Focus on server-side API development](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi#focus-on-server-side-api-development)
- [Change management](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi#change-management)
- [Cloud-based code generation and publishing](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi#cloud-based-code-generation-and-publishing)

# Getting Started

The Fern tools are available as a command line interface. To install it, simply run:

```
npm install -g fern-api
```

Once you have installed the Fern CLI, navigate to the root of your repository - or a different folder if you want to keep your SDKs separate from your backend code. You can either initialize a clean workspace using:

```
fern init
```

This will initialize a Fern workspace in the current folder, including the `./fern` directory that Fern will use to hold its resources. This will create roughly the following folder structure in your project:

```
fern/
â”œâ”€ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
â””â”€ api/ # your API
  â”œâ”€ generators.yml # generators you're using
  â””â”€ definition/
    â”œâ”€ api.yml  # API-level configuration
    â””â”€ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```

Here's what the `imdb.yml` starter file looks like:

```
types:
  MovieId: string

  Movie:
    properties:
      id: MovieId
      title: string
      rating:
        type: double
        docs: The rating scale is one to five stars

  CreateMovieRequest:
    properties:
      title: string
      rating: double

service:
  auth: false
  base-path: /movies
  endpoints:
    createMovie:
      docs: Add a movie to the database
      method: POST
      path: /create-movie
      request: CreateMovieRequest
      response: MovieId

    getMovie:
      method: GET
      path: /{movieId}
      path-parameters:
        movieId: MovieId
      response: Movie
      errors:
        - MovieDoesNotExistError

errors:
  MovieDoesNotExistError:
    status-code: 404
    type: MovieId
```

### Starting from OpenAPI

If you have an existing OpenAPI definition, you can use that as your starting point by specifying the `--openapi` option:

```
fern init --openapi ./path/to/openapi.yml
```

The path to the definition can either be a local file, or a HTTP resource. If you start from an OpenAPI definition, the `init` command will forego generating the default project files such as `imbd.yml`, and instead will use your definition as a starting point.

For example, you can use the following command to start a new Fern workspace based on an OpenAPI Pet Store definition:

```
fern init --openapi fern init --openapi https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
```

Which will allow you to directly generate clients in the next step.

## Generating an SDK

All SDKs are generated server side, so you don't have to worry about installing all the prerequisite tools locally. Before you can start generating files, you'll need to log in:

```
fern login
```

You'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account using your preferred browser.

After you have logged in, simply run the generate command to generate your SDKs:

```
fern generate
```

After your code is generated, the resulting artifacts are copied to the output directory specified in `generators.yml` , which we will touch on in the next section.

It is possible to generate the code on your own machine by using the `--local` flag. This does require you to run Docker on your local machine, and Fern will schedule containers to do the code generation automatically. This is further specified in the CLI reference below.

## Adding Generators

You can add generators using the `fern add`. You can have multiple generators for a single project, e.g. a single `fern generate` call could generate SDKs in Python, TypeScript and Java all in one go.

For instance, if you'd like to add a TypeScript generator to your project, simply run:

```
fern add fern-typescript-sdk
```

Which will add the Node variant of the TypeScript SDK to the list of generators - the other variant being a TypeScript browser library, to be used by frontends directly.

Your `generators.yml` file should contain the new generator:

```
default-group: local
groups:
  local:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
        version: 0.7.1
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../../generated/typescript
```

Note the `local-file-system` output may not be present by default. If it's not, simply add it and specify a local path to where the generated client will be saved.

## Publishing Clients

Fern supports automatically publishing clients to an NPM registry. By default, Node packages are published to `npm.buildwithfern.com` and are named `@organization-fern/package`, for example:

```
  - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
    version: 0.7.1
    output:
      location: npm
      url: npm.buildwithfern.com
      package-name: "@fern-fern/registry-node"
```

After your generate command has completed successfully, the package will be available on the specified registry.

## Next Steps

Define _your_ API in Fern. Check out our [Definition Documentation](https://www.buildwithfern.com/docs/definition) to learn more.

# Examples

These are some real world examples of Fern generating documentation and SDKs used in production:

* [Flatfile TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-node)
* [Vellum Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/vellum-ai/)
* [Vellum Docs](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/generate)
* [Flipt Java SDK](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-java)

# CLI reference

You can run the compiler by simply running the `generate` command:

```
fern generate [--group <group>] [--version <version>]
```

It will validate your API and run the generators specified in `generators.yml`.

#### Groups

You can optionally specify a group to run. This is useful if you want to generate an SDK for internal use in one language every time a new commit is pushed, but only want to generate a bunch of SDKs in various languages anytime a new release is created, for example.

If you don't have a `default-group` specified in `generators.yml`, then you must specify a group using the `--group` option. The default group is indicated by the `default-group: local` property.

#### Versions

You can specify a version using the `--version` option. This version string is used when publishing SDKs to registries (e.g. npm).

#### Local Generation

Generation runs in the cloud by default. If you want to run it on your local machine, you can use the `--local` option. This will run each generator in a Docker container.
By default, Fern will delete the container after running. To keep the container around (e.g. to look at the generator's logs), use the `--keepDocker` option.
