      summary: Improve performance of Pydantic `.dict` calls
      changed:
        - >-
          `.dict` performance is improved, consolidating to a single call to
          Pydantic's `.dict` instead of 2 in attempts to remove unset optional
          values.

        - >-
          Exposes `package_name` configuration option for pydantic models. This
          field controls the package from which users will import your client,
          for example, the following config would allow users to use: `from
          my_custom_package import Client`

      summary: Auto-completion for unions leveraging union utils now works as expected.
      fixed:
        - >-
          The root type for unions with visitors now has it's parent typed
          correctly. This allows auto-complete to work once again on the union
          when it's nested within other pydantic models.

      summary: Generated code now respects the pydantic version configuration flag.
      changed:
        - >-
          The generated server code now respects the pydantic version flag,
          generating V1 only code and V2 only code if specified. If not, the
          server is generated as it is today, with compatibility for BOTH
          Pydantic versions. This cleans up the generated code, and brings back
          features liked wrapped aliases and custom root validators for V1-only
          servers.

      changed:
        - >-
          The generator has now been upgraded to use Pydantic V2 internally.
          Note that there is no change to the generated code, however by
          leveraging Pydantic V2 you should notice an improvement in `fern
          generate` times.

        - >-
          Public fields previously prefixed with `_` are now prefixed with `f_`
          (Pydantic V2 does not allow for `_` prefixes on public fields and
          Python does not allow for a numeric prefix)
      removed:
        - wrapped aliases outside of Pydantic V1
        - custom root validators outside of Pydantic V1

          examples, this is a temporary solution while the example datamodel is

          The SDK now better handles cyclical references. In particular,
          cyclical references are tracked for undiscriminated unions, and
          update_forward_refs is always called with object references.
