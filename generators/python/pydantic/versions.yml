    type: feat
    added:

- version: 1.3.1
  created_at: '2024-08-05'
  changelog_entry:
    type: fix
    fixed:
      - The root type for unions with visitors now has it's parent typed correctly. This allows auto-complete to work once again on the union when it's nested within other pydantic models.

- version: 1.3.0
  created_at: '2024-08-05'
  changelog_entry:
    type: feat
    changed:
      - The generated server code now respects the pydantic version flag, generating V1 only code and V2 only code if specified. If not, the server is generated as it is today, with compatibility for BOTH Pydantic versions. This cleans up the generated code, and brings back features liked wrapped aliases and custom root validators for V1-only servers.

- version: 1.2.0
  created_at: '2024-08-04'
  changelog_entry:
    type: chore
    changed:
      - The generator has now been upgraded to use Pydantic V2 internally. Note that there is no change to the generated code, however by leveraging Pydantic V2 you should notice an improvement in `fern generate` times.

- version: 1.0.0-rc0
  created_at: '2024-07-16'
  changelog_entry:
    type: feat
    changed:
      - The generated models now support Pydantic V2 outright, it no longer uses `pydantic.v1` models.
      - Public fields previously prefixed with `_` are now prefixed with `f_` (Pydantic V2 does not allow for `_` prefixes on public fields and Python does not allow for a numeric prefix)
    removed:
      - wrapped aliases outside of Pydantic V1
      - custom root validators outside of Pydantic V1
