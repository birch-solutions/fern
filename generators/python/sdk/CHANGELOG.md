<!-- ## Unreleased -->

## [0.8.3-rc0] - 2024-01-29

- Fix: Increase recursion depth to allow for highly nested and complex examples,
  this is a temporary solution while the example datamodel is further refined.

## [0.8.2-rc0] - 2024-01-28

- Fix: The Python SDK better handles cyclical references. In particular,
  cyclical references are tracked for undiscriminated unions,
  and update_forward_refs is always called with object references.

## [0.8.1] - 2024-01-26

- Feature: If the auth scheme has environment variables specified,
  the generated python client will scan those environment variables.

  For example, for the following Fern Definition

  ```
  auth: APIKey
  auth-schemes:
    APIKey:
      header: X-FERN-API-KEY
      type: string
      env: FERN_API_KEY
  ```

  the generated client will look like

  ```python
  import os

  class Client:

    def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str = os.getenv("FERN_API_KEY"))
  ```

## [0.8.0] - 2024-01-25

- Fix: Enums in inlined requests send the appropriate value.

  ```python
  class Operand(str, Enum):
    greater_than = ">"
    equal_to = "="

  # Previously the SDK would just send the operand directly
  def endpoint(self, *, operand: Operand):
    httpx.post(json={"operand": operand})

  # Now, the SDK will send the value of the enum
  def endpoint(self, *, operand: Operand):
    httpx.post(json={"operand": operand.value})
  ```

## [0.7.7] - 2024-01-21

- Chore: Intialize this changelog
