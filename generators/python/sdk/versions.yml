      summary: Remove Pydantic field aliases and leverage an internal representation.
      fixed:
        - >-
          Pydantic field aliases are removed and replaced with an internal
          representation. This allows for more robust handling of field aliases
          and prevents issues with Pydantic V2 and mypy.

          Previously, you'd have for V1 and V2 compatibility in Pydantic, you'd want to conditionally apply the config class within
          the base model, however this would lead to mypy errors when filling out a model with it's field alias. To solve this, We
          used the deprecated `class Config`, regardless of the Pydantic version to satisfy mypy, which lead to warnings in the console.

          Now, we've removed the field aliases and replaced them with an internal representation, which allows us to avoid pydantic config altogether.

          Adds a new flag to generate forward compatible Python enums, as opposed
          to leveraging raw string enums as literals. This works through addding
          an "_UNKNOWN" member to your enum set, the value of which is the raw

      added:
        - >-
          A new configuration is introduced to make discriminated union member
          naming more Pythonic. With V1 union naming, member names change from
          `<UnionName>_<DiscriminantValue>` to `<DiscriminantValue><UnionName>`.
          Concretely, union members previously named `Chat_User` will now be named
          `UserChat` under the new configuration.

          The Python SDK can now be generated such that inputs to requests are
          TypedDicts, instead of Pydantic models. This allows for consumers of the

          Note this comes with an edge-case break. In the unlikely event you have
          a type that conflicts in naming with the exported root client, that type
          model is post-fixed with "Model". e.g. a type `Merge` in an SDK
          exporting a client `Merge` becomes `MergeModel`.

          Beta: The SDK now generates tests leveraging auto-generated
          data to test typing, as well as wire-formatting (e.g. the SDKs are
          sending and receiving data as expected). This comes out of the box
          within the generated github workflow, as well as through the fern cli:
          `fern test --command "your test command"`.

          Beta: Introduces a `max_retries` parameter to the
          RequestOptions dict accepted by all requests. This parameter will retry
          requests automatically, with exponential backoff and a jitter. The
          client will automatically retry requests of a 5XX status code, or
          certain 4XX codes (429, 408, 409).

          Introduces a flag `use_str_enums` to swap from using proper
          Enum classes to using Literals to represent enums. This change allows

          Transition from lists to sequences within function calls, this is a fix
          as a result of how mypy handles type variance. This fix is only for
          function calls as testing shows that we do not hit the same issue within
          mypy with list[union[*]] fields on pydantic objects.
      changed:
        - >-
          Improvement: The Python SDK generator now defaults to
          `require_optional_fields = False`. This means that any requests that
          have optional fields no longer require a user to input data (or a `None`
          value) in.

          Python now supports a wider range of types for file upload,
          mirroring the `httpx` library used under the hood, these are grouped
          under a new type `File`:

          Python now supports API specifications that leverage lists for file
          upload. Previously, Fern incorrectly made all `list<file>` type requests
          simply `file`.

          Add support for a RequestOptions object for each generated
          function within Python SDKs. This parameter is an optional final
          parameter that allows for configuring timeout, as well as pass in
          arbitrary data through to the request. RequestOptions is a TypedDict,
          with optional fields, so there's no need to instantiate an object, just
          pass in the relevant keys within a dict!

          Acknowledge the optionality of a `File` property, previously we were
          requiring all `File` type inputs, even if they were specified as
